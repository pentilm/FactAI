0,"A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. 

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. 
Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it."

5,"(NEWSER) – Wonder how long a Quarter Pounder with cheese can last? Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. ""We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,"" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend ""started off as a joke,"" he adds, but ""the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

Dean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and ""showed off the mold-free specimen,"" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called ""Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, ""Free the Burger,"" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)"
6,"Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.

Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.

Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.

The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.
In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.

While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.

Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.

ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.

“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”

A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.
Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.

“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.

“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.

Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground."
7,"At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said."
8,"There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!

So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.

Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:

1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.

Dear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute

2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.

We’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ

3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.

#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.

4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.

5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”

Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??

6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.

7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”

8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)

9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?

10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.

Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime."
9,"(CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.

AP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.

Local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,"" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.

But NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.

""It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,"" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.

""The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.""

The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.

NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.

Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.

The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.

NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.

Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the New York Post reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon's $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library.
In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.
""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We're often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""
This isn't the first time we've heard this rumor. The Wall Street Journal in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service — free to users, of course. Amazon, however, quickly shot down that rumor.
""We're often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming-media service,"" an Amazon spokesperson said at the time.

But the Post's sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix's current monthly price of $7.99, though.
""The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn't want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,"" a source told the news outlet.
Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine study found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.
Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.
On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a report from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly ""feature a curated selection of hotels within a few hours' drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.""
Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.

11,"We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Although doctors feared that the religious cleric would have suffered brain damage, he woke up only 48 hours later and has recovered from the heart attack.

Recalling his experience, the priest apparently said that he was engulfed by a feeling of unconditional love as he met God, who he described as a mother-like ‘being of light’.

He said: ‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting.

‘She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace.

‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more.’

O’Neal has reportedly said that he will continue to spread the word of God, despite the Archbishop of Boston moving to rubbish the claims of a ‘Holy Mother’.

He added: ‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman.’"

U.S. military officials say they are investigating claims that Islamic State fighters seized a cache of weapons that were airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces and meant for Kurdish militiamen.

A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Their claims would appear to correspond with those of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the militants had seized at least one cache.

U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims.

""We just don't know. We're still looking at it,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the ""vast majority"" of supplies ended up in the right hands.

The supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

In all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.

According to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, ""one of those bundles drifted off course."" But he said ""we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.""

On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

Kirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. ""We're aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,"" he said. ""All of that doesn't take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don't know.""

The lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

16,"Kai the shar pei-crossbreed was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr railway station in Scotland with a case containing a pillow, toy, food and bowl

A dog has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.

The Scottish SPCA is keen to trace the owner of shar pei-crossbeed Kai, who was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday.

He was accompanied by a case containing items including a pillow, toy, food and bowl.

The dog was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013 and the charity is appealing for information to help trace whoever bought him.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

PA   Pooch passing through: Kai was found tied to a railing at Ayr station

""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.""

Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.

He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.

The charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life."
17,"An article saying NASA confirmed six days of “total darkness” in December is fake and it’s merely an iteration of an old Internet hoax.

Essentially every year, there’s bogus rumors saying that there will be three days of darkness in December, but they’ve obviously proven not to be true.

They seem to reference the Three Days of Darkness mentioned by Catholic prophets.

However, a “satirical” and entertainment website, Huzlers.com, posted an article about six days of darkness. It uses fake quotes from a NASA official.

“WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,” it reads in part.

But Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it’s not real and shouldn’t ever be taken seriously.

“Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,” the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.

The bogus NASA article had tens of thousands of shares and “likes” on Saturday.

According to Snopes.com, similar rumors have been going on for a while and have taken on different forms.

“No, the universe is not about to realign in December 2014, nor will there be a three-day blackout at that time during which the Earth will shift into a new dimension. Neither NASA nor any other credible scientific entity has made such a pronouncement. Ever,” the site says. “This item originated back in 2012, when interest in the belief that the Mayan calendar would end on 21 December 2012 (thus foretelling the end of the world as we know it) was running high, and it has simply been updated and recirculated with the year 2014 replacing the original references to 2012.”"

The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.

Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there.

It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives — that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing — it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried."
23,"In a sprawling Facebook post and subsequent interview with Radar Online, a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a number of fascinating claims about herself and her alleged relationship with Michael Phelps. Among them: she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, met the Olympic swimmer on Tinder, and fucked said Olympic swimmer on their first date watching football on TV.

""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. ""Here is the truth.""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.
Citing an anonymous tipster (that could very well have been Chandler herself), The Hollywood Gossip previously named Chandler as Michael Phelps' companion the night of his latest DUI, a claim repeated in her recent Facebook post.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.
Today, Chandler followed up her announcement by giving Radar Online additional details of her supposed first date with Phelps after meeting him on Tinder, which involved watching a Baltimore Ravens game at the athlete's home. ""One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,"" Chandler told the site. ""Later, we had sex again.""

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the ""threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""

I am telling my story to take the power away from the media and tabloids that want to hurt Michael and I. I will probably lose him, which hurts like hell.

24,"Macaulay Culkin is not dead. The actor is just next victim in a long line of Hollywood death hoaxes.

The rumor started when a Facebook page was made to memorialize the actor.

""At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page,"" read the post on Facebook.

A fake news report also claimed that the ""Home Alone"" star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. Fortunately, none of this is true. 

The actor's representatives issued a statement about the hoax.

""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and, well, stop believing what you see on the Internet."" 

This is not the first death hoax aimed at the actor. Back in April, rumors spread that Culkin was found dead.

Culkin is currently a member of rock band Pizza Underground. The band covers Velvet Underground songs with pizza-themed lyrics."
25,"DUBAI - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: ""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ""snow bride"" wearing a bra and lipstick. ""The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. ""It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"" one wrote.

""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.""

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East."
26,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

27,"Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.

“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”

32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”

Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”

Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.

“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”

Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. For more information or if you would like the group to visit your child’s school call (785) 273-0325. To contact Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, call (602) 542-4331.

29,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny.

A British rapper now fighting with the Islamic State (aka ISIS) is reportedly a suspect in the beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to several unconfirmed published reports, including the Independent.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny, is allegedly one of three British jihadists identified as possibly being the masked murderer known as “John the Beatle,” according to the Daily Mail.

A former hostage held by ISIS said Bary is one of several jihadists nicknamed “The Beatles” because of their British accents. He has a similar accent, build and skin tone to “John,” the man who killed Foley, according to a report published in the Telegraph. 

""We have not identified who the man in the video is at this time,"" a representative from Scotland Yard told Billboard.

Bary was an aspiring rapper whose music was played on BBC Radio in 2012, according to the Independent. He left his home in Maida Vale, West London, to fight in Syria’s civil war, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah,” the Daily Mail reports.

Bary’s songs have been posted online, with titles like “Overdose,” “Flying High,” “Dreamer” and “The Beginning.” His music makes reference to violence, drug use and threats of his family being deported to Egypt. “I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings,” he reportedly raps in one song.

Bary, one of six children, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on charges tied to the deadly bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, according to the New York Post. Earlier this year, Bary reportedly tweeted a gruesome photo of himself holding a severed head under the name “Terrorist” (@ItsLJinny). The account has since been deactivated.

30,"DNA tests confirm Lebanon is holding the young daughter of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the country's interior minister says.

Nohad Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was now believed to be one of Baghdadi's ex-wives.

On Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said they had detained his wife and son at a border crossing with Syria.

But Iraq's government later insisted the woman was not married to Baghdadi.

It said the woman - identified as Saja al-Dulaimi - was the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front.

She is also thought to have been detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Nusra.

Pregnant

Late on Wednesday, Mr Machnouk told MTV that Ms Dulaimi had been travelling with two sons and a daughter when they were detained by the army two weeks ago.

""Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,"" he said.

""Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child.""

The minister added: ""We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [Baghdadi's] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq.""

It is not clear how the Iraqi authorities have the IS leader's DNA. However, in 2005 he was arrested by US forces in Iraq and spent the next four years a prisoner at Camp Bucca, near the southern town of Um Qasr, before being handed over to the Iraqi authorities and then released.

Mr Machnouk said Ms Dulaimi's children were staying at a care centre while she was being interrogated at the defence ministry's headquarters.

IS has not commented on their detention, but al-Nusra has condemned it.

One Lebanese official has said it is a ""powerful card to apply pressure"" in negotiations with IS and al-Nusra, who are holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and police hostage. They are threatening to kill them unless militants are freed from Lebanese jails."
32,"FERGUSON, St. Louis (CNN) — Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown’s shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man’s attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots — a cluster of six, followed by four.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” the man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN’s Don Lemon. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man’s recording late last week from a mutual friend.

“I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,” Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It’s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'”

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown’s death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown’s body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience storeshortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson’s credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn’t understand why some are questioning his credibility.

“I see they bring up my past, my history, but it’s not like it’s a long rap sheet,” Johnson told Lemon. “This one incident shouldn’t make me a bad person.”"
34,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, who went by the rap name L. Jinny or Lyricist Jinn, is a suspect in the beheading of journalist James Foley this week.

Bary, 24, is said to have left home last year to join rebels in Syria. According to TMZ, he had music played on the BBC.

The Independent newspaper reported that he tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head earlier in August. ”Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” he tweeted.

Ex-ISIS hostages have said that he has the nickname “John the Beatle” because of his British accent. Some analysts have said that the killer in the Foley video had a British accent.

Bary had lived in Maida Vale, located in west London, reported the Independent.

His father was Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee who is said to have been an aide to Osama bin Laden.

In tracks he uploaded to YouTube in 2012, Bary talks about violence and drug use. ”It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he said in one of his tracks. ”I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.

He added: “I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.”

The Associated Press update: Obama again faces tug of military action in Syria WASHINGTON (AP) — For three years, President Barack Obama has resisted the pull of potential U.S. military action in Syria.

He has held firm even as the civil war’s death toll climbed toward 200,000, the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians and Islamic State militants strengthened amid the chaos.

Now Obama must decide whether the extremist group’s murder of American journalist James Foley, as well as the broader threat the group could pose to U.S. interests, should change his cautious calculus.

Pressure is coming from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State inside Syria. But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.

White House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.

“We’re actively considering what’s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we’re not going to be restricted by borders,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “We’ve shown time and again that if there’s a counterterrorism threat, we’ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.”

Even before Foley’s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.

After running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.

Obama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obama’s remaining time in office.

“What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,” said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

That may be particularly true in Syria, where President Bashar Assad’s government is warring with opposition forces. Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.

The Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.

Obama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.

The risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.

Obama’s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.

“This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,” said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.”

To White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obama’s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic State’s rise.

Without a course correction, Obama’s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.

“If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISIL’s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.

Obama’s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States. The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region — Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular — to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied.

The U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain, France, Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing, military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria, and if necessary, joining the U.S. in military action."

It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

As for shipping date, iGen.fr’s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date. That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine’s Day present right now, isn’t it?"

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected individual

Ebola has a 90% casualty rate in areas such as West Africa. In America the mortality rate is 50/50

Five people are confirmed to have the Ebola Virus in Pardon County

CDC quarantined the area, erecting road blocks and disallowing anyone in or out of the area

A staff member at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contacted National Report with a short statement about the Ebola situation in Texas. The individual wished to remain anonymous for their own safety, and told us the following,

“As far as we know, Jack Phillis had not come in contact with neither the late Thomas Duncan or Mrs. Phan. It is perhaps possible that he was within a close proximity of the infected parties, but it is otherwise unknown as to how Phillips was infected with Ebola.

The CDC wasted no time sealing up the rest of the town’s denizens, and has stopped all traffic entering and exiting Purdon, TX. As of 10 Pm, Oct. 13th area has been surrounded with police and CDC officials. Communications with the locals seems to have been cut off, and press is currently awaiting an official statement from local authorities."
44,"This is the shocking moment a US Marine gets shot in the head by a Taliban sniper – but is saved by his helmet.

Captured on a helmet-mounted camera, the video shows three Marines during a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2013.

Upon hearing gunfire, the team move out to determine where it is coming from.

They travel through a short tunnel and then into another, where they all pause just before exiting.

Without warning, a bullet, presumably from a sniper, cracks against the helmet of one of the soldiers.

“We got a sniper,” the Marine filming exclaims, before the group rush back to protected area.

Complaining that their ears are ringing, they inspect the helmet which was hit before resolving to find out where the sniper is located.

Watch the video of the incredible incident below.

45,"Zack Snyder recently unveiled an official photo of the Batmobile from ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" But immediately after came word that one of the Batmobiles has been stolen. Nobody was surprised since production is going on in Detroit, a city with the highest crime rate.

Warner Bros never confirmed the report and its still unclear whether the vehicle was ever stolen. But Snyder just took to Twitter to make light of the situation, posting a photo of the Gotham City police recovering the Batmobile and arresting the individual responsible. ""Case closed,"" he wrote.

Meanwhile, we also have a video of the Batmobile being taken out for a spin. This is one of many videos out there. Some others show a second car with a camera on the roof recording the Batmobile in motion. Check everything out below."
47,"After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy. Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.

The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.

""In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,"" Thompson explained. ""By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.""

In other words, don't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon."
48,"The interwebs was all aflutter today with news that elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy’s real identity:



According to reports:

“…The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. “We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said.”

“We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

(ABOVE: According to reports, this is a photo of Banksy, AKA Paul Horner, seen here being taken into police custody.)

Despite the “if it’s on the internet, it must be true” adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn’t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy’s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

So we can all breath a big sigh of relief… inhale, exhale… Banksy is still a mystery. Someone. Somewhere. Phew."
51,"A Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard was sealed off because a person who lives there is sick with something that may be contagious, a source close to KCTV5 News says. (KCTV)

A Kansas City TV station, KCTV-5 reported Saturday night someone was being quarantined at Rockhill Research Hospital (Research Medical Center), according to their sister station in Wichita, KWCH.

A source in Kansas City confirmed the story to the Gateway Pundit and added some details.

A Nigerian woman was taken to the hospital with a high fever and Ebola like symptoms. Her apartment building was quarantined, though that may have been lifted later.

The source added the Nigerian woman initially tested negative for Ebola and was released (or set to be released) but was called back to the hospital. The source said parts of the hospital may be quarantined but the hospital is not confirming anything.

The CDC is reportedly on the way, according to the source."
53,"'The urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls'

When it comes to promoting equality of the sexes, we tend to think that we’ve come a long way in the past 40 years.

But a letter that is believed to have been included in a 1974 Lego box set appears to show that the much-loved Danish toy company started to get there a good while before everyone else.

According to a post on the online community platform reddit.com, Lego sent a message addressed “To parents” inside the box of assorted building blocks, explaining how “the urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls”.

It’s a powerful sentiment that has seen the image shared widely since user fryd_ first posted it on Saturday morning.

He said that he came across the letter while playing “with his niece and nephew at their Grandma’s house”, and that it was in a set “from 1973 with a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house”.

Here is the letter in full:

“To Parents

“The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

“It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

“A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

“The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.”

While the image appears to include a copyright from 1974 and the name of a printer in Hamburg used by Lego at the time, the authenticity of the letter could not be independently verified, and a spokesperson for Lego was not immediately available for comment.

User fryd_ commented that “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” since the letter was written. But others disagreed – with Taliesen13 responding: “That sounds like the moral of The Lego Movie.”"
54,"A nun living in an Italian convent has given birth to a surprise baby after complaining of stomach pains, according to the Italian press.

The nun, who came to Italy from South America, belonged to an order called the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ in Macerata, located in the Italian region of Le Marche.

She says she had no idea she was pregnant.

She was taken to hospital by her sisters, where doctors quickly told her she was pregnant, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere Adriatico.

The baby is healthy and the nun’s convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him.

The nun arrived at the convent in June, when it is now believed she was already pregnant.

According to the Italian newspaper L’Unione Sarda, the convent said the woman ""is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping” possibly because she had not yet taken her vows.

The woman, who is reported to be from Bolivia, has now been discharged from hospital."
55,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk."
56,"A man accused of attempting to rape a girl in India has been left in a critical condition after locals cut off his genitals as punishment.

The group took the law into their own hands after they found a 40-year old man pinning a young girl to the wall in the north-eastern city of Ganganagar.

After a community meeting, the vigilantes dragged the man into a nearby butchery and used a meat cleaver to cut off his penis. The remains were discarded in the street beside the man, who was suffering from severe blood loss.

One local said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"" the Daily Mirror reports.

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.""


She said it would ""send out a very strong message"" to possible offenders, warning them of the punishment they face.

Police were quick to condemn the attack, warning locals not to take the law into their own hands and calling for those responsible to hand themselves in.

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.""

The young girl was treated for shock and is receiving counselling, while the man remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Incidents of rape in India have gone up tenfold in the last 40 years, The Guardian reports, with a spate of recent attacks shocking the nation and the world. Last year a 23-year old woman died after being gang raped on a bus in the Indian capital. ·"
59,"This is the moment a group of Russians captured video footage of what they believed was a Yeti walking through the woods.

The footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later.

A team had set out in search of the mysterious creature after local television reported that it had been sighted in a remote region an hour's drive away from the city of Adygeisk.

Sighting: A team of Russians believe they have captured footage of the elusive Yeti in a remote patch of woodland

Footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later

They said they had questioned residents at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen it - and on speaking to others in the area managed to secure reports of several independent sightings.

The group claim they heard the crunching of snow as they headed out to investigate before capturing footage of the creature, which they describe as covered in hair.

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow.

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.'

Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

'Although we didn't see anyone we saw its huge footprints. They were five to six centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot.

Big foot? Some have suggested the video was just a stunt to bring in tourists while others are convinced this was the first proof that the yeti exists in the area

'We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.'

The plaster cast and the footage have now been handed to local scientists and will go to the local council by the end of the month.

60,"The White House is attempting to verify footage released by the Islamic State (IS) purporting to show the killing of an American journalist in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

The video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man cloaked in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The White House said it was working to establish the video's authenticity, but if it was genuine, the US would be “appalled by the brutal murder”.

Foley has worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya and Iraq. He and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped in November 2012 near the village of Taftanaz.

The video opened with a clip of US President Barack Obama saying he had authorised strikes in Iraq. “Obama authorises military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen. It showed black and white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife. “I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement he beheads the kneeling man.

The video also shows a second man on his knees, who is named as Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. After bringing out Sotloff, the masked executioner addresses the US President directly, saying: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

The Islamic State had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The video was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. A Twitter account set up by Mr Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”"
61,"NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to North Korea’s leadership said yesterday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old’s health and grip on power.

North Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened.”

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source.

“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” added the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort.”

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

The source with knowledge of Kim’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish.”

Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Yesterday’s edition of the Workers’ Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page."
62,"Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.

Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.

The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   “We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"" Salkida wrote on Twitter.

But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.

“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. ""The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.""

Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.

Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.

On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.

“On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.

As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.

Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, "" he said.

Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset"" will be directed towards the girls' release. ""Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"" he said.

""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"" he added.

After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.

But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.

Boko Haram is ""deeply fractured,"" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a ""difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"" Stratfor said.

""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"" the group added.

In the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. ""We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press."
63,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had surgery in Pyongyang in mid-September to treat fractures to both ankles and remains in hospital, a source claimed Monday.

The source, who recently visited the North, said, ""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended."" 

The source added Kim had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, in mid-September and is now recovering there. 

The source said bodyguards have been posted around the ward and security remains tight. ""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" the source added. 

One intelligence official here said Kim's official car does not appear to have left Pyongyang, so it is likely he remains in the capital. 

The official said Kim is overweight and appears to have sprained his ankles during a grueling tour of military bases and factories in Cuban heels. Kim is around 170 cm tall and has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.
There has been speculation that his obesity and binge drinking brought on gout. The official Rodong Sinmun daily recently said Kim ""labored on"" by visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather. 

Kim missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang on Thursday. 

A government official here said, ""It's unlikely that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.""

State TV in a rare admission on Thursday showed footage of Kim limping and admitted he is ill. South Korean intelligence also learned that a team of doctors from Europe recently went to North Korea."

McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.

McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.

One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”

What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?"

In the state of Colorado, marijuana dispensaries are big business – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers were so appealing to the KFC Corporation, they decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.


 
The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License.

Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this “option” to their menu.

Although the ad was originally posted to eBay’s career page way back in November, it has only recently come to light through an ad posted to LinkedIn. The ad says that it is looking for a dev to join eBay’s New Technology Group, which operates out of Portland with over 200 engineers.

According to the ad, the ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app.” That seems to indicate that whatever presence the eBay app has on the Apple Watch, it will tie into the core iPhone app.

What kind of functionality will the eBay Apple Watch app have? That’s up for speculation, although an alert app that lets you know when you’re about to be outbid, when your items have sold, and when a new watched search term pops up on the world’s largest internet auction site are all a good bet."

Less than two weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio broke off talks with Sony to play Steve Jobs, the studio has set its sights back on Christian Bale.

Sources say Sony is beginning negotiations with The Fighter actor, who was originally eyed to play the late Apple Computer co-founder back when David Fincher was in talks to direct. The move comes after Bale's negotiations with Fox to star in The Deep Blue Goodbye hit a roadblock. Sources say Fox was trying to include sequel options for Bale to tackle the lead role of Detective Travis McGee in what is hoped to be a franchise starter, but the actor balked. Now, talks are ongoing with Bale without sequel options, but even if a deal is reached, the actor would shoot the Jobs project before Deep Blue Goodbye.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled Jobs film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin and is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years. Sony optioned the best-seller in 2011, around the time of Jobs' death.

74,"At least one of five Taliban militants released by the Obama administration in a controversial exchange for American soldier Bowe Bergdahl has ""attempted to reestablish contacts"" with the Taliban in Afghanistan, U.S. officials told NBC News on Thursday.

There was no indication the former prisoner, being held in Qatar, made contact with the Taliban. The officials said it is unclear whether this was an actual attempt to rejoin the Taliban militants in Afghanistan.

""We're closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat"" from the attempted communication, a senior U.S. official said. The official could not say exactly how the former prisoner tried to reach the Taliban.

The five Taliban militants, including two top leaders, were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in May. As part of the deal that led to Bergdahl's release, they had to remain in Qatar under a one-year travel ban set to end in June.

The militant who tried to reconnect with the Taliban had ""several phone calls"" with family members in Afghanistan, a senior official told NBC. There was no indication the calls, monitored by security officials, involved any ""threatening activity or planning,"" the official added.

Nevertheless, the U.S. will try to have restrictions placed on out-of-country calls though the prisoners are allowed to communicate with relatives and other visitors in Qatar.

Bergdahl was reportedly captured by the Haqqani terrorist network in Pakistan after he left a remote outpost in June 2009 and held for five years. Bergdahl could be charged with desertion."
75,"HBO is in talks with Apple over a partnership that would see its upcoming standalone web-only subscription television package available on the Apple TV, reports Michael Learmonth, writing for International Business Times. CNBC has also confirmed that Apple and HBO are in talks in the video tweet posted below.

BREAKING: Sources tell @JBoorstin that Apple & HBO are in talks for Apple TV to be a launch partner for 'HBO Now'. https://t.co/hQd9AzA3Xr— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 4, 2015
Apple could potentially be one of HBO's launch partners for its web-only service, which may be called ""HBO Now."" News of HBO's web-based subscription service first surfaced in October of 2014, after HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the company's plans at an investor presentation.

The service, aimed at cable cutters, will allow users to access HBO content without a cable subscription for a set monthly fee. With the launch of a cable-free subscription service, HBO will become the first major premium content provider to cease limiting its television and movie offerings to cable subscribers.

According to Learmonth, HBO's web-only subscription will launch in April alongside the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which takes place on April 12. The service is said to cost $15 per month, which is roughly how much it costs to subscribe to HBO through a cable company. A partnership with Apple would allow the service to be watched on the Apple TV, much like the existing version of HBO's service, HBO Go. HBO Go is available to all existing HBO subscribers on a variety of devices like the iPad and Apple TV, but it requires an HBO subscription through a cable or satellite provider.

Cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast have long been reluctant to offer piecemeal pricing and companies like HBO have previously avoided moving away from traditional cable models in order to preserve the status quo and avoid upsetting existing revenue streams.

The introduction of HBO's service will be a major victory for cord cutters, and it could encourage other content providers to introduce similar offerings. Content providers' reluctance to shift away from traditional cable pricing models has been one of the major factors that's prevented Apple from establishing deals for its own service in the past.

76,"Border Patrol agents detain immigrants who crossed from Mexico into the United States near McAllen, Texas, June 27, 2014. The state’s Rio Grande Valley has been the epicenter of a surge illegal immigration in recent months.  Molly Hennessy-Fiske/Los Angeles Times / MCT

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said that the assertion that ISIS-affiliated terrorists were arrested while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is “categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.”

But the vice president of the largest union representing Border Patrol agents told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that DHS — which oversees the Border Patrol — is incorrect. And he said, the incident highlights the need for more funding for the Border Patrol,

“I haven’t been able to outright confirm that it happened, but from what I have heard it sounds very credible,” said Shawn Moran, the vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 17,000 Border Patrol employees, “From what people have read to me, from what they say they have seen in documents, it seems pretty legit.”

Moran admitted he had not seen the document himself. He added that he did not know the name of the official who prepared the report, or what agency did that official work for, but that his “instincts told” him the official was with the Border Patrol. He also declined to tell BuzzFeed News who had told him about the report in the first place.

When asked what would be the appropriate response to the alleged incident, Moran said that the Border Patrol needs more funding and more people to do its job and prevent ISIS from entering the U.S. again.

A spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss Moran’s specific statements, but insisted that “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

Moran’s statements Thursday followed allegations from two Republican lawmakers who told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured.

The persistence of these rumors may stem from the arrests in September of four people with suspected ties to terrorism that were later found to be unfounded, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a speech Thursday.

“Four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker’s Party – an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq,” said Johnson. “Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.”

Reports that terrorists affiliated with Islamist groups have tried to enter the United States through the southern border have circulated around the web for months, even before ISIS became a household term.

In July, for example, members of a volunteer armed militia told Breitbart News they were concerned because they had found what they thought was a “Muslim Prayer Rug” in the Arizona desert.

Thus far, the threat embodied by that alleged rug has failed to materialize."
77,"Ahmed Abdi Godane is the spiritual leader of al-Shabab

He is believed among six people killed in a U.S. airstrike on two cars near the al-Shabab stronghold of Barawe

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Kenya in September 2013 that killed 67 people

U.S. officials have not yet confirmed Godane is among the dead

U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people.

U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles.

Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa.

Ahmed Abdi Godane is believed one of six people killed when a drone fired on his two-car convoy in Somalia on Monday night, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the death

Dangerous as ever: Even though al-Shabab fighters have been kicked out of the capital of Mogadishu, they have continued attacking targets throughout Africa

Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month.

The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured.

The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack.

In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now.

A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press.

'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said.

U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack.

'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda

'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.'

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert.

The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.'

Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting."

82,"It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.


The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

Asked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, ""The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.""

In his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying ""the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God."" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity.""

“I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.


The original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.

The capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.

After hours of work, Pam Hatchfield, a conservator at the Museum of Fine Arts, dislodged a time capsule from the cornerstone of the State House.

 Mass. time capsule contents include 350-year-old shilling

Hatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.

The box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.

“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”

Galvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.

It is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.

On Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.

From about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.

As she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.

As the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.

“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”"
89,"EXTREMISTS fighting for the Islamic State (IS) have started launching bombs packed with live SCORPIONS.

Bomb canisters – packed with the venemous arachnids – are being blasted into towns and villages to scatter scorpions and incite panic, a British military expert has revealed.

Former head of chemical and biological weapons for NATO and the British army Hamish de Bretton-Gordon described the arachnid attacks as ""madness"".

He told The Daily Mirror: ""It’s madness.

""IS have improvised devices to launch them.

""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

""Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.""

The 24in scorpion bombs are not used for mass casualties but instead designed to maximise the terrorist group's ""psychological impact"" on the villagers.

Mr Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he had been advising security forces, added: ""The main thing is creating fear.""

Senior officials in Iraq have reported scorpions being used against civilian targets in northern parts of the country.

There are 25 known species of scorpion with venom capable of killing a human being.

References to 'scorpion bombs' have been found dating back to 198 AD.

The bizarre biological weapon was created when Iraqis began pouring scorpions into ceramic pots to hurl at the Roman armies storming the fortress city of Hatra.

The scorpion-filled weapons have even been credited by some with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.

91,"The dedicated pet owner initially refused to pay for the procedure to save the 3-inch fish at Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk, but quickly changed his mind.

A British man forked out $460 to save the life of his goldfish — after it became constipated.

The dedicated owner took his blocked-up 3-inch pet to a vet after realizing it was struggling to pass waste, reports the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

He was stunned to be told that the delicate operation needed to solve the problem would cost $460.

Shocked at the high cost, he initially refused to give Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk the go-ahead.

93,"A Chinese woman spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ‘needed time to think’.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant.

Tan said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan.

For seven days Tan ordered chicken wings with extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home

Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think'

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.'

Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up

He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken.

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents.

It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.'

95,"Kabul: A recent footage of a sniper bullet hitting a US marine on the helmet during a helicopter raid in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, has gone viral on social media.

The importance of wearing a helmet when on the field of battle has been perfectly illustrated in a video uploaded to YouTube by a US marine.

In the video, three marines are seen to move through a bunker in search of a source of gunfire. As they come near to the exit point, a bullet suddenly bounces off the Kevlar helmet of the middle soldier.

The three men then quickly retreat to the back of the building to inspect the damage to the soldier's helmet. After ascertaining that the Marine is unharmed, they regroup to consider their options.

Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold reportedly said that the video was shot while ""conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013"". The footage was uploaded to YouTube last month, and has since received just under 200,000 views."
99,"Shane Smith, the sometimes controversial but always press-friendly CEO of Vice Media, has found another way to make news: reportedly spend $300,000 on a Las Vegas meal.

On a Tuesday earnings call, MGM Resorts International boasted that someone had recently spent $300,000 taking some acquaintances to dinner at one of its restaurants. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that it was Smith.

The Vice co-founder spent the large sum of money at Bellagio's Prime Steakhouse when he was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show last month, Bloomberg reported.

Smith can certainly afford to pick up the tab after A+E Networks and Technology Crossover Ventures each invested $250 million in Vice for 10 percent stakes, on top of a $70 million investment from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.

Vice fashions itself a cutting-edge media company that eschews tradition and on occasion even courts danger. It made worldwide news when it took former NBA player Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters to North Korea to hang out with Kim Jong Un.

Smith has hinted at an IPO for Vice and guesses it could be worth $20 billion, likely an exaggeration, but an IPO of practically any magnitude would probably make him a billionaire.

A Vice spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that Smith won ""well north of"" $300,000 while playing blackjack during his trip to Las Vegas and it was the money from that windfall that funded the dinner.

Still, the reveal of the $300,000 dinner might cause Smith some angst, given that he is being accused in some circles of living the good life while underpaying Vice staffers. 

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" says a recent report from Gawker. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

Then again, at a company party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to a $1 million expenditure, according to insiders.

104,"NO AMOUNT of money is enough for Led Zeppelin front man Robert Plant to get the band back together.

The 66-year-old singer walked away from a 35-date tour that would have paid the rock group nearly $924 million — ripping up the contract in front of stunned promoters, The Mirror newspaper reported.

British tycoon Sir Richard Branson had planned to reunite the Stairway to Heaven rockers and promoters had even gotten the green light from the other band members.

The mega deal would have paid Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones roughly $346 million apiece, before taxes, according to The Mirror.

Group members lobbied hard for Plant to join in but he wouldn’t change his mind.

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” a source close to the group told The Mirror. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

A big payday would have also gone to Jason Bonham, 48, the son of late drummer John Bonham.

The 35 shows would have been split between London, Berlin and a site in New Jersey, according to The Mirror.

“Jimmy, John and Jason signed up immediately,” the source said. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

105,"As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

107,"Never fear, Banksy fans: the infamous street-artist has not been unmasked, despite frenzied reports on American websites.

Online news sites were subject to a hoax on Friday from US ‘media troll extaordinaire’ Paul Horner.

Sites Complex, Death and Taxes, and Jezebel published online stories stating that Paul Horner, 39, had been identified as the street-artist known as Banksy, and had been arrested by British police in Watford.

Horner is in fact editor of the cunningly-named Super Official News website, where he makes statements such as: “Until then just remember, if it’s on the internet it must be true”, and that “Paul Horner is an American hero.”

Website NationalReport said that “London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards” had held a press conference unmasking Banksy after the arrest - but according to the Met, no such officer exists. However, there is a dairy farmer called Lyndon Edwards.

Other Banksy pretenders incude,‘cap man’ in New York, 2013; Robin Gunningham in Bristol, 2008; Mr Brainwash in 2010; and Rose Biggin, an 89-year-old from Camden, North London, who was touted as the elusive street-artist. The pensioner said of her “I’m Spartacus” moment: “It sure does help to pass the time.”

Even a Battersea charity shop got in on the act – earlier in October someone from the Fara shop on Northcote Road not pretending to be the artist painted a Banksy-style mural and tweeted it soon after."
108,"WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a ""porous"" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.

Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.

But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.

""Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.

Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.

Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said ""is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)

On Ebola, Johnson said the government is ""heavily engaged"" and is ""enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""

""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"" he said.

Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.

Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.

Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.

""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"" he said.

Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a ""setback,"" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.

""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"" he said. ""Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that."""
109,"There is no end to Apple’s woes when it comes to the iPhone 6

Forget #bendgate, iPhone 6 Plus users have discovered a new woe to add to their list of complaints, and it already has its own hashtag: #hairgate.

After reports that Apple’s new handset bends if enough pressure is applied to it, users are now taking to Twitter to claim that the smartphone is catching hairs from people’s heads and beards and pulling them out.

“I’m concerned about my iPhone 6 Plus, keeps yanking out my hair when I’m making a call,” an anonymous user wrote in a community post on 9to5mac.com.

According to Twitter users, hairs get stuck in the fine seam between the glass and the aluminium on the new handsets.

When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were first released, numerous pictures of the handsets that had been unintentionally bent appeared on Twitter.

While Apple says it has only received a handful of official complaints about the issue, it is thought that the new phones are susceptible to being bent because the iPhone 6 Plus is so much larger than previous phones.

At the time, Apple said that with “normal use” a bend in the iPhone should be “extremely rare,” and that the new handsets feature “steel/titanium inserts to reinforce stress locations and use the strongest glass in the industry”."
110,"As a series of ex-soldiers come forward to criticize Brian Williams for his ‘stolen valor’ Iraq war story, it is being reported that top level executives at NBC News had known the tale was fake and had been begging the newscaster for years to stop repeating it.

Williams is at a center of a media firestorm after he was found out for embellishing an old war story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade during the Iraq war in 2003.

The newscaster acted swiftly on Wednesday night to attempt to diffuse the situation by apologizing during his Nightly News show, but since then a series of ex-soldiers have come forward to criticize Williams ‘half-hearted’ apology.

Brian Williams is at the center of a media firestorm over his embellished war story and now it transpires that NBC News executives - and Tom Brokaw - had known for years that the story was false

To make matters worse there are also now reports that senior executives at NBC News, including legendary anchor Tom Brokaw who Williams replaced in 2004, knew the story was false.

‘Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,’ an insider told the New York Post.

Now Brokaw, 74, has had it and wants Williams fired, the Post claims.

Senior executives had in the past asked Williams to stop telling the story in public, reports Variety.

Despite his credibility being called into question, Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his Nightly News broadcast on Thursday evening but unlike on Wednesday he didn't address the issue during the broadcast.

'Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,' said the source.

Retraction: NBC anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as he claimed in a broadcast on Friday, pictured

However a separate source says that isn't going to happen. 'He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,' said the source.

On Thursday the pilot of the army chinook that was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades told the Omaha World-Herald that he had contacted NBC News not long after their initial broadcast. Don Helus said he saw Williams’ initial report not long after its original broadcast after someone emailed him a clip.

NBC’s Tom Brokaw introduced the report with the words: 'Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq.'

Helus said he contacted Williams’ producer and asked for a retraction, but didn't get a reply.

'My crew was a little upset about that - somebody trying to make a claim to inflate their career,' Helus said.

Williams was forced to apologize on air and on Facebook on Wednesday and admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter that was hit, but had been traveling in a separate aircraft more than half an hour behind that landed without incident.

'He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind [the other helicopter] about 30-45 minutes later,' Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Miller, the flight engineer on the helicopter that carried the journalists, wrote on Facebook after NBC shared a link to Williams' story.

Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error

'He had the audacity to tell me the whole thing was like 'Saving Private Ryan' and that the whole army would be out looking for him. I called him an idiot in front of his camera crew and he didn't come back to my bird for the next three days.'

Pate Butler, another soldier, confirmed on Facebook: 'He flew with the Savannah birds in a totally different flight. Never was shot at. That aircraft was out of Germany and we were all in that flight.'

Lance Reynolds, another soldier who had actually been on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit, also lashed out at Williams on Facebook.

'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft,' he wrote. 'I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened.

'Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News.

'The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.'

Speaking to Stars and Stripes, Reynolds recalled how he had been aboard the helicopter when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.

The damaged Chinook made a rolling landing at an Iraqi airfield, skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the desert. Reynolds and other crew members were unhurt.

Called out: Lance Reynolds, left, and Pate Butler, right, who were both part of the crews flying that day, said that Williams had not been aboard their damaged helicopter and expressed their anger at his lies

Anger: The day after Williams' report, Reynolds responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differently

Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response'

'It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me,' he told Stars and Stripes.

'I know how lucky I was to survive it. It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.'

When Williams approached him and took photos of the damaged aircraft, Reynolds said he dismissed the level of danger because he didn't want his wife to see a news report about it.

'I wanted to tell her myself everything was all right before she got news of this happening,' he said.

Another man on the downed aircraft, Mike O'Keeffe, said he had long been bothered by Williams' false claims.

'Over the years it faded,' he said, 'and then to see it last week it was - I can't believe he is still telling this false narrative.'

O'Keeffe added that he was satisfied with Williams' apology and didn't want to push the issue any further or 'kick the guy when he is down'.

Other soldiers have accused Williams of being misleading in his apology and continuing to imply details that are false.

Denial: Williams denied that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor' in a message he posted on Wednesday

Since the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.

NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.

'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.

'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.'

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'

For example, army flight crews told Stars and Stripes that Williams implied he was flying with the same company that the downed helicopter belonged to - but he was actually flying with a different company in a different direction, and only linked to the unit by radio.

He also suggested that his aircraft was forced to land because of the attack, but soldiers said it was landed due to deteriorating weather conditions.

After Williams' apology, there were cries for him to be terminated.

'Brian Williams has to go,' Brent Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, wrote on Twitter. 'NBC's credibility is completely shot.'

The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire.

He repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment about a public tribute at a hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided security for the grounded helicopters.

During the report, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - and the soldiers expressed their anger on Facebook afterwards.

'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.'

On the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.

'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize,' he said.

In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error.

'I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,' he wrote.

'Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area - and the fog of memory over 12 years - made me conflate the two, and I apologize.'

Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor'.

'I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.'

All the credit: After his apology, Twitter users joked about Williams inserting himself in other historic events

One of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers.

'#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,' tweeted one person.

'And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod.' #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,' wrote another.

Williams appeared nonplussed about the scandal on Wednesday evening as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks

The two shared plenty of laughs and thrills at the game only hours after Williams apologized for his 'mistake'

His reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the next year helped earn NBC a Peabody Award.

112,"The man who scaled the White House fence this month actually ran through the building into the East Room, much farther than the Secret Service initially disclosed.

The intruder overpowered a Secret Service officer posted near the door before penetrating deep into the mansion’s main floor, the Washington Post reported:

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The female officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

The White House fence-jumper made it through the North Portico doors (top) and into the East Room (far right). (Image source: whitehouse.gov)

The Secret Service initially indicated Gonzalez was tackled just inside the main entrance of the mansion, saying he was “physically apprehended after entering the White House North Portico doors.”

114,"A TEXAN plumber is getting death threats after his old truck — still bearing his name — was tweeted on the front line by Islamic jihadists in Syria.

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pick-up truck, complete with anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

SYRIAN WAR: 10 points to help understand what’s going on

IS EXPLAINED: How it fits into Syria and Iraq

Subsequently his company Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pick-up truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at the office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told Galveston Daily News.

“People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal off the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

The nun, who is originally from South America and arrived at the convent in June, was taken to the emergency department of Bartolomeo Eustachio di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters.

The baby was born healthy but remains in hospital to undergo further checks.

117,"Reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest.
Now the latest explanation for Kim Jong Un's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg.  
A source with access to the secretive North's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.
North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3. 
The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.
He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest
'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. 
'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 
He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.
Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.
'Kim Jong Un is in total control,' said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.
If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.
'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. 
North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.
It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.
He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.
Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.
Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.
Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.
The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.
'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.
North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.
Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.
However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.
Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked 'the Marshal' for his support during the competition.
Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.
'Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,' he said."

119,"TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) — A Texas plumber is getting some unwanted attention after one of his old company vehicles appeared in a photo posted on an Islamic militant group's social media account.

Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City has been flooded with calls after the picture appeared on Twitter, The Galveston County Daily News reported.

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this vehicle, believing AutoNation would remove it.

""They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it,"" Oberholtzer said. ""How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know.""

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

""A few of the people are really ugly,"" he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

""I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,"" he said.

120,"An attorney representing a man who says he realized he had inadvertently recorded audio of the Michael Brown shooting has provided that audio to CNN:

Attorney Lopa Blumenthal says the recording was made during a video chat. The audio captures what seem like 10 gunshot sounds—an initial group of six, then a pause, then four more. An autopsy of Brown's body performed at his family's request by an experienced forensic pathologist named Michael Baden indicated Brown was hit by at least six shots.

Eyewitness Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's, has said that officer Darren Wilson fired several shots at Brown after Brown had turned toward him and raised his hands. The Baden autopsy indicated that Brown had been shot exclusively in the front of his body.

Blumenthal says the man who made the recording has spoken to the FBI.

121,"Claim: Deandre Joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in Ferguson.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]

Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.

Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.

The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:

This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?

However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.

""He was not a witness,"" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):

As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.""

ISIS sympathisers took to social media to identify the 'cub fighter' by his alleged nom de guerre Abu Ubaidah, adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in Syria in recent weeks, but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against.

Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September.

The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media.

One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over.

Another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars.

Other images show him posing with a man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi'. In those images the boy identified as Abu Ubaidah is seen calmly holding another large rifle while surrounded by bearded men wearing military clothing.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Still flying: This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city."
126,"The Apple Watch was unveiled alongside the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on September 9, but apart from Apple detailing its features, not many specifications were detailed. However, an analysts citing supply chain sources claims to have narrowed down a significant proportion of the specifications.

According to Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company (via AppleInsider), Apple's smartwatch will feature 512MB of RAM, likely supplied by Samsung, Hynix and Micron. The Apple Watch is also being tipped to come in 4GB and 8GB variants, with the 4GB model the standard version. Arcuri says the flash-based storage will be procured from ""most major NAND suppliers.""

Arcuri also predicted that Broadcom BCM43342 chipset might act as the wireless combination chip for the Apple Watch. Interestingly, the chipset includes a GPS radio functionality, which is ""somewhat at odds"" with Apple's announcement of the Watch requiring to be paired with the iPhone for GPS data. The report speculates that either Apple has used a modified version of the chipset, or disabled GPS functionality for better battery life.

Scheduled to arrive in early 2015, the Apple Watch's wireless charging circuit seems to be supplied by Integrated Device Technology, while the NFC chips, power management integrated circuits, MEMS sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi front-end chips are said to be supplied by NXP and AMS, Maxim Integrated Products and Dialog Semiconductor, Invensense, STMicroelectronics, and Skyworks respectively.

The Apple Watch was launched alongside the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets at the firm's keynote event earlier this month. There are three variants of the Apple Watch - Watch Sport, Watch Edition and the Watch.

Across the three variants, there are a total of 18 different styles of straps available, which means that users will be able to customise the Apple Watch - both physically and in terms of software, to stand out from others, but Apple hasn't given out details on the pricing of different designs yet."
130,"Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning."
132,"Critics slammed Vogue’s recent Kimye cover as “disgusting,” but what’s happening in the offices lately is even worse! RadarOnline.com has learned that New York City’s dirtiest rats have rolled out the red carpet to welcome Anna Wintour and Vogue staffers to their swanky new offices at the Freedom Tower. According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture!

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover,” a Vogue staffer revealed. “There was so much backlash, and now this!”

Condé Nast and Vogue recently decamped from Times Square to the new digs at One World Trade Center, and the move has not gone off without a hitch.

Vogue occupies floors 25 and 26, and “this is where the rats have taken up residence,” a source said. “Condé Nast has floors 20 through 44, but the rats are confined to the Vogue floors only. Hey, New York City rats are smart: they know where the good stuff is!”

“The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Now, the source said, “A strict no food or drinks policy at people’s work stations has been issued until the infestation is gone.” (The source said pin-thin Wintour does, in fact, normally allow staffers to eat in the office.)

But meanwhile, “It’s very unnerving to come to work in the morning, and find rat droppings on computers, and desks!” the source said. “Anna isn’t amused and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.”

Gawker, which broke the story, says Wintour has told assistants that her pristine office must be rat-free before she enters.

146,"US drones are being flown over Isil's Syrian ""capital"" for the first time as part of a drive by America to target Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadist group's elusive leader.

Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa have captured photo and video footage of remotely-piloted planes, which Western weapons experts have identified as American Predators, the same drones used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists.

The US has not publicly stated that it is flying drones over Syria, and the sightings over Raqqa are the first indication that it is doing so.

The sightings are the clearest indication that President Barack Obama has dramatically changed his policy, aggressively stepping up reconnaissance of Isil positions as the US works to assemble an international coalition to fight the jihadists.

That diplomatic effort was given a major boost on Monday when Iraq's parliament finally voted to approve a new government aimed at winning broad support against Isil, with Haider al-Abadi as prime minister.

Mr Abadi, a member of Iraq's Shia majority, whose candidacy was supported by the US and other western powers, had promised to include members of the Sunni minority as well as Kurds within his government. The attempt to heal sectarian rifts is seen as vital to undermining Isil's appeal in the Sunni heartlands, where disaffection with the previous Shia-dominated government assisted the extremist Islamist group in its rise.

Mr Obama immediately called Haider al-Abadi, the new prime minister, and urged him to move quickly to address ""the legitimate grievances"" of Iraq's disenchanted Sunnis.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said the formation of the unity government was ""a major milestone"" for Iraq.

MPs in Baghdad also voted to approve three senior figures in the largely ceremonial role of deputy presidents: Nouri al-Maliki, ousted as prime minister in July, Osama al-Nujeifi, a Sunni and former parliament speaker, and Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia politician who refused to join the last government.

But the all-important posts of interior and defence ministers would be filled over the next week, Mr Abadi told MPs.

In the battle against Isil, the Pentagon told the Telegraph on Monday that it had ""not yet conducted any strikes against targeted individuals"", but refused to rule out the possibility that it was using drones for surveillance.

The US is trying to pinpoint the location of Baghdadi, the jihadist who has declared himself the caliph of captured territory in Iraq and Syria that is the size of Britain, and ruler of its eight million inhabitants.

Several residents of Raqqa and jihadists from Isil have captured pictures of a white drone circling overhead, reporting that it flew low over the city for most of Friday and again on Saturday.

Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, an anti-Isil activist in Raqqa who posted pictures of the drone, told The Telegraph he had first seen it on Friday. ""It flew over the city for about three hours, from noon until 3pm,"" said Mr Raqqawi, who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity.

Mr Raqqawi also reported seeing it on Saturday at the same time that other residents posted news of the sightings online.

Experts said they believed the aircraft was an unarmed MQ-1 Predator on a reconnaissance flight. Aaron Stein, an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said it could be identified by its ""distinct downward facing V-shaped tail"".

Mr Stein said that the photographs indicated the drone was unarmed. ""The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery - and possibly signals intelligence - of Islamic State positions in the group's most important stronghold.""

Killing Baghdadi would be a major coup for the US president, who has been widely criticised for not taking tough enough action against Isil.

Its impact on the jihadist group is less certain, however: Baghdadi sits at the apex of an elaborate hierarchy, with a ""cabinet"" of deputies who manage the group's military operations and domestic governance.

In the event of his death, power would probably transfer to his deputy, Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, a former commander in Saddam Hussein's military who is in charge of Isil's Iraqi territory.

In July Baghdadi made a surprise appearance in Mosul, Iraq's second city, where he led men in prayers at the city's Great Mosque, but he rarely shows himself publicly and little is known about his whereabouts since then.

Raqqa, a key city in Isil's embryonic ""state"", would need to be scrutinised closely in any hunt for Baghdadi.

Mr Obama would be required personally to order a strike against the Isil leader, weighing the advantages of his death against the risk of civilian casualties, but Aki Peritz, a former CIA counter-terrorism analyst, predicted he would do so if the opportunity arose.

""The US is already exerting lethal force against the Islamic State. If it had the opportunity to take its top dog off the battlefield once and for all, the US would pull the trigger,"" Mr Peritz said.

The US president is due to give a speech on Wednesday preparing the American public for a campaign against Isil tha officials believe could extend beyond Mr Obama's remaining two years in office.

In an interview with NBC, Mr Obama said the US would fight Isil in a manner ""similar to the kinds of counter-terrorism campaigns that we've been engaging in consistently over the last five, six, seven years.""

He has put drone strikes at the heart of America's global struggle against jihadist groups. Last week the US announced it had killed the leader of Somalia's al-Shabaab terror group."
147,"Tiger Woods is not serving a suspension from the PGA Tour for failing a drug test, his agent and a Tour official emphatically stated Monday.

“These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,” Mark Steinberg said in a statement (via ESPN). “They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.”

The allegations were made by golf pro Dan Olsen on 730 The Game radio in East Lansing, Mich., Friday. “I’ve heard that he’s suspended,” Olsen said on “Mad Dog in the Morning.” “I heard he’s on a month’s suspension. And it’s not, it’s kind of a strong witness. It’s a credible person that’s telling me this. Well, it’s not testosterone, but it’s something else.”

Woods, who has struggled mentally and physically with his game, announced Feb. 11 that he was taking an indefinite leave from golf, saying his game “needs a lot of work.” Among his many injuries over the last few years, he underwent a microdiscectomy last spring. He was withdrawn from play three times because of an injury and no longer ranks among the world’s top 70 players.

On Monday, Olsen, a 48-year-old who last played on the Tour in 2011, was walking back his allegations.

“Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts,” Olsen told ESPN. “I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview. And I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [Commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour.”

Olsen had questioned the Nike ball with which Woods plays, too, saying, “I would almost bet hadn’t been tested. … So he’s really playing with — I’m not gonna say a cheater ball, because he has the help of the establishment, really — but he played a ball that nobody else could play. … So that combined with his enhancement issues, like having a Canadian blood spinning doctor in his phone, you know? I mean, I think people are starting to openly call it what it is, which is gonna be a problem for him.”

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, shot down the report Monday, too, and the Tour, according to ESPN, says it is required to announce a suspension.

“There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,” he told USA Today. “We categorically deny these allegations.”"

149,"What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 
The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

class=""cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3"">In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""
Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson."
151,"A husband who thought he had lost a recording of his late wife's voice he had kept for more than 10 years has described the moment the message was recovered as ""wonderful"".

Stan Beaton, from Mirfield, had kept the voicemail since his wife Ruby's death in 2003, but technical work by Virgin Media meant it was deleted.

However, the telecoms company has now managed to recover the message.

Mr Beaton, 68, said: ""They've made this old age pensioner extremely happy.""

Listening to the message he said: ""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.

""I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""

Mr Beaton told BBC Radio Leeds the message he had kept since his wife's death from cancer was lost in December.

He said: ""I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed.

""Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

""In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

""In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.""

Mr Beaton contacted Virgin who managed to retrieve the message which has now been permanently saved for him.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, said finding it ""was like searching for a needle in a haystack"", however a team of 11 engineers spent three days tracking it down.

""The chances of its recovery were slim"" he said, but the missing file containing Ruby's voice was found on Friday.

""The next morning we called Stan to deliver the good news,"" he said."
152,"In the Omsk region of Russia, a teen boy developed ""superpowers"" after he suffered electric shock. The boy, Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, discovered that he could attract metal items. He currently considers an idea of becoming a superhero.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me,"" the boy, a second-grader, told Omsk TV and Radio Company.

Electric shock changed the boy's life. He has now become the most popular boy at school. Classmates often ask him to demonstrate his superpowers. Moreover, Nikolai can ""share"" his power. According to his peers, he can influence others so that people turn into live magnets as well. 

""I could even hang a ladle on my nose,"" Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina said.

Journalists compared Nikolai to Marvel Comics character Magneto, who had similar abilities. The boy also says that he wants to become a superhero, although his teachers say that Nikolai is a very kind and friendly boy. 

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received an extensive media coverage - the people obtained the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although the people, who have the ability to attract metal items, are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body. Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Researchers of the anomalous say that environment around us is filled with various vibrations - mechanical movements, electromagnetic vibrations, molecular vibrations, etc. We all live in an ocean of electromagnetic waves. Some people may act as magnet coils, accumulating and intensifying energy, making various items stick to their body. Some researchers believe that such anomalous phenomena are more common in the areas where ecological situation is poor. People may mutate under the influence of environment and develop such unusual capabilities. Some may develop stronger mutations and even levitate. Levitation is also a manifestation of mutations. For example, in medieval legends, witches and wizards would be of abnormally low weight, and could even hover above the ground."

The bogus report read: ""Nasa has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December.

155,"Comcast allegedly pulled strings to get one of their customers fired from his job at a prestigious accounting firm after he complained about billing issues and false charges. The former Comcast customer, identified only as ""Conal,"" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast ""the worst company in America"" two years running.

Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year.

According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.

But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment.

Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.

And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist:

On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as ""bizarre,"" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with ""How can I help you?"" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint.

Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer—who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast—Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company—because Comcast cares.

Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job.

Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer ""is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn"" about his customer service struggle.

It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer.

They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services.

Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America!

156,"It is the most expensive - and many would argue delicious - part of a sushi menu.

But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm.

The Chinese man had gone to his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin.

To his horror, scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish.

One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm

The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish

Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage.

When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh.

Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish.

Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body.

Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong.

If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.

Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated.

He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China.

Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections.

Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm.

While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,.

This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician.

Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor.

'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.'

Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream.

This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.

158,"Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."

“I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating, I decided I needed time to think,” she said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

After three days in the 24-hour joint, the staffers noticed that the woman had not left. She told them she needed more time to think and ordered more wings with extra large fries.

Canada is assembling a camp in Kuwait to launch its own air campaign over Iraq, sending six CF-18 fighters, two surveillance craft and a refuelling aircraft to help the U.S.-led coalition’s air strikes against Islamic State. The government says Canada will be in a position to begin air strikes against Islamic State at some point within the last seven days of October.

JETS: FIRST SIGN OF ISLAMISTS USING WARPLANES

Islamic State has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

“They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,” Abdulrahman said. “People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,” he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 kilometressouth of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. “We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,” he told a Pentagon news briefing, referring to Islamic State by an acronym.

LONDON: POLICE ALLEGE ISLAMIST PLOT TO KILL POLICE

Four men appeared in a British court on Friday, charged under anti-terrorism legislation with swearing allegiance to Islamic State militants and preparing to launch an attack on policemen or soldiers on the streets of London.

The four, who were arrested over the past two weeks, are variously charged with obtaining a handgun and conducting “hostile reconnaissance” of Shepherd’s Bush police station in west London and the nearby White City reservist army barracks. Further charges include storing images sent via photo-sharing service Instagram of two police officers and of two civilian police community support officers.

“This is a plot, in essence, to shoot, to kill, police officers or soldiers on the streets of London,” prosecutor Mark Dawson told Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

Tarik Hassane, 21; Suhaib Majeed, 20; Nyall Hamlett, 24; and Momen Motasim, 21, all from the London area, were remanded in custody after a brief hearing to appear at the Old Bailey court on Oct. 27. They have yet to enter a plea. A fifth man, Nathan Cuffy, 25, also from London, was remanded in custody on firearms offences.

BRITAIN: A 14TH-CENTURY TREASON LAW REVISITED

Britain may use a medieval law dating to 1351 to charge citizens with treason if they go to fight with Islamic State insurgents in Iraq and Syria, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said.

Security officials say some 500 Britons – largely with Muslim immigrant backgrounds – are believed to be fighting in Iraq and Syria, though the true figure could be much greater and security officials worry that those who return could carry out an attack on Britain.

Hammond said any British citizen who had sworn personal allegiance to Islamic State could have committed an offense under the Treason Act of 1351, passed during the reign of England’s King Edward III. The maximum sentence for treason in Britain is life imprisonment. It was death until 1998.

The last person to be hanged for treason in Britain was William Joyce, a propagandist for Nazi Germany nicknamed Lord Haw Haw who broadcast to Britain during the Second World War and who was executed in 1946.

167,"LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.
18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.
One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.
18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.
.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300
A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200
Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold

Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street
The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street
This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

This is a $10,000 product
This is a $10,000 product
Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.


I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

170,"Leading up to the somber anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, there are fresh fears of possible 9/11-style attacks taking place across North Africa as radical Islamist groups in Libya have reportedly seized nearly a dozen commercial airliners in the last month.

While counterterrorism officials are reportedly concerned that the missing jetliners could be used by terrorists to carry out deadly attacks, the timing of the theft is also setting off alarms. The concern is that radical Islamist groups will use the planes to mark the anniversary of the deadly 9/11 attacks, according to alleged intelligence reports disseminated within the U.S. government.

Reports that Islamist militias have seized the jetliners come just weeks before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. … We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” one official reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon.

The aircraft were reportedly stolen in August after Islamists took control of the Tripoli International Airport. It was later reported that 11 commercial jetliners were missing.

On Sept. 11, 2012, four Americans were killed during a terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. At first, the Obama administration blamed the attack on a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim YouTube video.

When pressed by the Free Beacon, a “senior State Department counterterrorism official” refused to comment on reports of stolen jetliners in Libya. Another State Department told the online publication, “We can’t confirm that.”

It was also reported on Tuesday that Islamic State militants beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff. Just as they did when they murdered photojournalist James Foley, the terrorists reportedly uploaded a video showing the gruesome execution.

171,"WASHINGTON — A U.S. Republican senator and frequent Mideast traveler said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban but operates with some degree of autonomy.

The five detainees released were:

Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence.
Mullah Norullah Nori, a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.
Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul.
Mohammad Fazl, who Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

173,"Nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a 12m-wide crater near Managua's international airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press. ""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a team formed to study the event believed the 5m-deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to Earth. She said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation.

The meteorite may have been a fragment of a house-sized asteroid nicknamed Pitbull, which hurtled past Earth on Sunday night at a distance of 40,000km.

Dan Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, said that although the Nicaraguan impact occurred 12 hours before Pitbull passed Earth, Central America was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid.

Pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun.

""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom. But a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that,"" Brown said.

Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, told the AP it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site. The meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater, or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil.

Witness accounts of the meteorite strike would help scientists confirm when the meteorite struck and the path it took – information that could link it to Pitbull or rule out the asteroid as the source of the rock. Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was strange no one had reported a streak of light. ""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

If investigators can find remnants of the meteorite in the crater, then its chemical makeup could be compared with measurements of the larger asteroid taken from ground-based telescopes.

""It's a wake-up call that we need to understand more about the flight paths of asteroids,"" Brown said."

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you might experience on January 4, 2015 if this story is true.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

181,"While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

185,"A photo provided by the Nicaraguan Army shows an impact crater made by a small meteorite in a wooded area near Managua's international airport. Photo: AP

Managua: A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday night, local time.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed ""2014 RC"", which passed very close to Earth on Sunday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres wide, or the size of a house.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Dr Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes.

""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,"" he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"" Dr Martinez said.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be about one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach, which astronomers had calculated would be on Sunday about 1818 GMT (4.18am on Monday AEST).

186,"The sound of 10 or 11 shots from the gun of Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson being fired at Michael Brown were recorded by a man in an apartment near the Aug. 9 shooting, according to the man’s attorney who shared the audio with CNN.

The network aired the recording Monday but has not verified its authenticity.

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man’s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

“At the time he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” Blumenthal said. “It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson’s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown’s movements and Wilson’s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired “more than just a couple [of shots]” but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

Ilic contacted emergency services when he could not stop the bleeding and was taken to hospital in the east Macedonian town town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also lying in the bin.

Doctors were initially unable to re-attach his penis but he was then transferred to the capital, Skopje, where it was reunited with his body following five hours of surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it would ever function properly again.

The Po River and Delta are known for massive wels catfish, but anything bigger than 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare, and this one measured 8.8 feet.

The U.K. Mirror reported that Ferrari’s fish could possibly be the world’s biggest wels catfish caught with a rod and reel, though records of this sort are difficult to confirm.

The Mirror and NT News reported that the biggest wels catfish ever recorded was a 9.1-footer from the Po Delta, but they differ on its weight—one reporting it as 308 pounds, the other as 317 pounds. The method of that catch is uncertain.

Sportex Italia, Ferrari’s sponsor, called his fish the “world record spinning torpedo,” which might mean it’s a world record for a Torpedo spinning rod made by an Italian manufacturer, though it also simply says it’s a “world record in the spin fishing for catfish.”

Regardless, Ferrari’s fish is one of the biggest wels catfish recorded in recent history.

Ferrari told GrindTV that the fish took an artificial bait on the surface, and the fight from a boat lasted 40 minutes.

The best part about Ferrari’s catch is that after he and his brother, Dario, weighed the fish, they released it back into the delta so it could fight again another day.

Ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, reports emerged that Islamist militias took control of nearly a dozen jetliners last month after the airport was the scene of a fierce battle.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital to the militants, who include the Islamic groups Ansar al Sharia - which has ties to the Islamic State - and Libyan Dawn, an umbrella group for Islamist militias.

The country is currently witnessing its worst spasm of violence since former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011. Intelligence officials have been told in the last two weeks of the possibility that one of more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month, according to the Washington Free-Beacon.

""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,"" one official told the Free-Beacon. ""We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.""

Damaged airplanes on the tarmac at Tripoli international airport

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the World Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks; it will also be the second anniversary of the Islamic militant-led raid of the US Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya when four Americans, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed.

In July 2014 fighting broke out in the area of Tripoli International Airport, Libya as anti-government and pro-government militias were engaged in fighting. As a result, Tripoli Airport was closed for air traffic and many aircraft were damaged as result of the devastating fighting.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are now being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade who plan to use them in terror attacks.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera there is ""credible intelligence"" that the Masked Men Brigade ""is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.""

A commander for the Libyan Dawn group said earlier this week his forces had entered and been in control of the US Embassy compound in Libya's capital since last week.

A video posted online showed men playing in a pool at the compound. In a message on Twitter, US Ambassador to Libya Safira Deborah said the video appeared to have been shot in at the embassy's residential annex."
190,"Variety is reporting that Seth Rogen's got the part as Woz in Jobs, the upcoming Aaron Sorkin-penned take on the Apple icon. Christian Bale had already been cast in the title role, and this new addition... it's surprising, but kinda great.

Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, and Trainspotting fame will direct the drama—which at one point was going to be a David Fincher affair—and it sounds like the whole film will offer a somewhat unconventional approach to the life of this tech icon.

Sorkin told Business Insider earlier this year: ""It's not a biopic."" Okay! So, that already sets it apart from the Ashton Kutcher joint. But also: ""It's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that."" It's been rumored that the whole film will be three looong backstage scenes set right before big product launches, so maybe that means an epic walk-and-talk sequence that spans the full feature-length?

I know some folks had their heart set on Jonah Hill, but I'm down with Rogen. Woz, we know you're out there: What say you? [Variety]"
193,"Leak Wars: director is fed up with plot details leaking from the set of The Force Awakens
LAST UPDATED AT 14:41 ON Tue 10 Feb 2015
Unconfirmed reports from Movie Pilot and Ikwiz suggest that director JJ Abrams wants to bring forward the release of the hotly anticipated forthcoming Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, to this summer.

The rumour comes from an industry event – the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 – where Abrams is said to have told attendees he was frustrated with the slow drip of leaks from the set.

According to Movie Pilot, Abrams is worried that the leaked images and plot details will ""ruin"" the film before it gets to fans. Ikwiz says: ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams's request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

The film has been scheduled for release in December this year – with the next two instalments in the series following in 2017 and 2019, according to Disney boss Bob Iger.

Releasing The Force Awakens in the summer would be ""an extremely brave move"" says Movie Pilot, as it would put the latest Star Wars up against box office heavyweights including Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long-awaited Jurassic World."

Nohad Machnouk also says that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was married to IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi six years ago for a period of three months. He says they are no longer married.

Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television late Wednesday that Iraq sent Lebanese authorities DNA samples from al-Baghdadi to test against the woman, identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, and the girl.

He said the girl and two other children detained with al-Dulaimi are being held in a child care center.

The Hollywood Reporter broke the news Monday that Bale had exited discussions on the Steve Jobs biopic being directed by Danny Boyle.

Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had just been on Bloomberg TV stating that Bale was a slam dunk for the part.

""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Christian Bale,"" Sorkin said on Oct. 23.

Looks like it's time to find the next best actor.

THR, quoting unnamed sources, reported that Bale ""after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.""

A representative from Sony Studios had no on-the-record comment about the report.

Boyle reportedly is in town this week to meet with actors and actresses for the part. Seth Rogen is in discussions to play the key role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak."
200,"Breitbart Texas reports:

An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

An Examiner.com article seems troubled by this.

This, though, is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in America. El-badawi is right that Catholics have long gone to Catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage. Orthodox Jews have long gone to Jewish religious courts (such a court is called a “beth din”) both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes. Some Protestants sometimes do the same; 1 Corinthians 6:1 is often interpreted as calling for that.

There are three ways in which these tribunals’ decisions have practical effect.

1. Parties’ respect for the system: Religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law. For instance, a Catholic who doesn’t get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry, even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment, simply because he feels that God wants him to follow the church’s teachings and decisions.

2. Social pressure: Would observant Muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia tribunal’s ruling, when that will affect how their coreligionists, business partners, neighbors, and family members perceive them? You bet. Would Orthodox Jews feel the same? You bet, and I expect that Christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction. For an interesting, but rare, case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so, see Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (9th Cir. 1987). (I think that, even in the absence of the Free Exercise Clause that were made in that case, but that might be unavailable in many states following Employment Division v. Smith (1990), a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the Free Speech Clause, see NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982).)

Indeed, one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations (not to steal, not to commit adultery, and more). The flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with (stay with a husband who mistreats you, never remarry, and so on). Of course, if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure, then the law can step in to punish the violence, and any explicit threats of violence. But the possibility of such violence in rare cases doesn’t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases.

3. The parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement, under which they agree that the tribunal’s decision would be enforceable in civil court. Such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration, even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than American law (e.g., English law or French law). And they are also permissible for religious arbitration.

There are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular American court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race, religion or sex. I discuss this a bit in this post, and the comments to it are also much worth reading. But according to the Breitbart Texas article, El-badawi says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations; rather, their decisions are followed — when they are followed — as a result of the parties’ acquiescence and community pressure. As a result, these interesting questions don’t arise here.

Religious communities have long had the right to use standard American contract law — coupled with the standard American liberty to exert social pressure on your family members, friends, neighbors and business partners — to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes. That’s especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community members’ own religious feelings, or by social pressure. But that can also be so, subject to some limitations, when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration (which, again, doesn’t seem to be in play with the Texas Islamic tribunal).

The remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community (or the religion). That is of course often very hard, for personal and economic reasons. It’s hard for Muslims. It’s hard for Orthodox Jews (and especially groups such as the Satmar Hasidim). It’s hard for Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Amish, and members of lots of other groups. But that’s a necessary aspect of American social and religious freedom."
203,"HBO plans to launch its stand-alone Net video service next month on Apple TV and other devices, according to the International Business Times.

The news generated a bump in Time Warner  (TWX) stock, pushing it to $83.80. Shares closed at $83.08, down 0.1%, and were down slightly (0.15%) in after-hours trading at $82.96.

Sources familiar with HBO’s plans told IBT that Apple TV was among the devices that the streaming service, to be called HBO Now, would be available on at launch. The price for the service, which like Netflix would not require a pay-TV subscription, would be $15 monthly, sources said.

When contacted, HBO offered this statement: “We know there’s great anticipation around our stand-alone streaming service. And when we have details to share, we will do so.”

Back in October, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said the network planned to debut a stand-alone streaming service in 2015. Various reports, including IBT‘s Wednesday suggest HBO wants service up and running when its series Game of Thrones returns April 12 for its fifth season.

“It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO,” he said at the time.

Neither Apple nor MLB Advanced Media, which is reportedly providing the streaming technology for HBO, had comment on the report."
204,"Seven girls, ages 13 to 15, are pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls got pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents, he said, should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education, so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

205,"New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

209,"A Taliban commander exchanged for the release of a POW attempts to return to the battlefield, raising questions about closing Guantanamo

When U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in May to exchange five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay for Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier who had been held captive for five years, his political opponents had a field day. They warned that the detainees risked returning to Afghanistan, and to militancy. Obama, with the backing of the government of Qatar that had agreed to host the men, promised that they would be kept far from the battlefield. Seems that the men may have had other ideas. According to CNN, U.S. military and intelligence officials now suspect that at least one of the detainees has made contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, suggesting that he, and perhaps the others, may be planning a return.

Considering that 29 percent of all U.S. detainees who were held in the Guantanamo detention center are either suspected of or confirmed to have returned to the fight, according to a March 2015 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, it shouldn’t be all that surprising. TIME’s Massimo Calabresi predicted as much back in June, just after Bergdahl was released. The recidivism rate, he wrote, “suggests that statistically at least one of the Taliban leaders will return to the field to fight Americans in Afghanistan, or elsewhere.”

At the time of the exchange, Taliban commanders who had been involved in Bergdahl’s capture, captivity and release, told TIME that the exchange — five of theirs for one of America’s — would encourage them to seek out more P.O.W.s. So far, that hasn’t happened. It’s not clear which of the five former detainees was reaching out to associates in Afghanistan, but as high-ranking commanders and former comrades-in-arms of Taliban leader Mullah Omar, any one of them could galvanize a movement that is slowly making gains in the wake of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan. Even if those plans have now been foiled, the incident may have one other far reaching consequence: as Obama attempts to close down Guantanamo for good, his opponents now have more ammunition for why he should not.

210,"Hailed as a hero: Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. Photo: Reuters

Ottawa: As Canada comes to terms with finding itself in the firing line of militant Islamists it turned for reassurance to a 58-year-old former Mountie formerly best known for carrying a golden mace.

As parliament's sergeant-at-arms, Kevin Vickers' role is largely ceremonial, symbolising the authority of the body and keeping order in the chamber wearing a bicorne hat and tail coat.

But on Wednesday, when a lone Islamist gunman stormed the building, he put pomp and circumstance to one side, found a gun and fired the shots that brought the rampage to an end.

He was back in the chamber on Thursday, a humble hero at the centre of attention, applauded to the rafters by members of parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper crossed the floor to shake his hand. Opposition leader Tom Mulcair praised his ""heroism"".

Mr Vickers took charge of security on Parliament Hill - a collection of government buildings overlooking the Ottawa River - in 2006, after a 29-year career in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

He was an experienced officer, reaching the rank of chief superintendent, but he is not usually armed.

So when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau charged through the front doors of parliament he reportedly had to return to his office to open the lockbox where he kept his handgun.

The attacker had already shot a security guard in the leg in an exchange of gunfire and had run down the Hall of Honour towards the library, where he took cover in an alcove next to Mr Vickers' office.

Mr Vickers reportedly emerged, threw himself to the ground to present a smaller target, and shot the assailant three times.

It was the first time he had ever shot anyone, a family member told local media.

""He always put his nation and his community first and foremost,"" his brother John said.

""We're just tremendously relieved he's OK and very, very proud of him and what he had to endure today.""

Video images showed Mr Vickers calmly walking back to his office, his automatic pistol still in his hand at his side.

He is said to have entered a nearby conference room where Conservative MPs had been holed up to reassure them: ""I put him down.""

""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers,"" Justice Minister Peter MacKay said in a Twitter message.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino also said he was ""profoundly grateful"" to Mr Vickers and to security forces for their ""selfless act of keeping us safe"".

One senator called him a hero while reporters heaped praise on him for his quick actions that ""saved lives"".

""Remind me to hug Kevin Vickers the next time I see him,"" said Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Kady O'Malley.

In a statement, the humble officer said he was ""very touched"" by all the attention but said it must be shared with his ""remarkable security team"".

""Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team,"" he said.

The son of a dairy farmer and a nurse, he was born in Chatham, New Brunswick.

A letter that supposedly accompanied Lego boxes in 1974 has been making the rounds on the Internet this week. The letter reminds parents that ""the urge to create is equally strong in all children...boys and girls."" Take a look:


Source: Imgur
The letter was first posted by Reddit user fryd_, who said he unearthed the letter ""with his niece and nephew at their Grandma's house"" in a box with a ""blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house.""

If real, this letter perfectly aligns with Lego's history of egalitarian advertising that hasn't pigeonholed its products to just boys.

But like everything on the Internet, the legitimacy is being questioned. The writers at iO9 are less skeptical, pointing to the letter's use of Lego's 1970s logo, which is slightly different than the one used presently. As for further evidence for authenticity, Lego's ads in that era used similar fonts. Lastly, there's a German version of the letter that reads almost identical to this one.

The evidence is convincing that it's legitimate and it would be a bizarre thing to fake. It's a compelling statement to make for the 1970s — and more importantly, it still holds true today.

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl’s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that “knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.”

She added: “Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.”

Recent incidents include a 15-year-old teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered in India in September, and a six-year-old girl who was raped at a school in Bangalore in July."
217,"International experts have raised doubts as to whether a 12m-wide (40ft) crater near the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, was caused by a meteorite.

Nicaraguan officials announced on Sunday that a ""small meteorite"" had come down near the airport.

But Nasa scientists say the fact that no-one reported seeing a fireball in the sky would suggest it was caused by something else.

So far no meteorite fragments have been found in the crater.

'Like a bomb'

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time on Saturday and reported a burning smell.

A crater 12m wide and more than 5m deep was later found near Managua's international airport.

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was ""convinced it was a meteorite"" which caused the impact.

But Head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office Bill Cooke said that ""for something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball, and nothing was reported"".

Managua has a population of 1.2 million people and many residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling a shock wave.

Victor Gutierrez, a mechanic who lives less than a kilometre from the site of the crater said that he ""heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong''.`

But he stressed that he ""didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.""

Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said it was possible nobody was looking up at the sky when the event took place close to midnight.

'Alternative explanations'

Nasa's Bill Cooke estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of ""roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT [explosive material]"".

In his blog on the NASA website, he said that a meteor capable of such force would have created a fireball visible over a wide area.

On Sunday Ineter scientist Jose Millan had insisted that ""all the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event"".

""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"" he added.

Government spokeswoman and First Lady Rosario Murillo said the crater was created by a ""relatively small meteorite"" that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

But Nasa asteroid expert Don Yeomans said the impact felt in Managua ""was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of [asteroid] 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated"".

Mr Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to ""someone out blowing things up"".

Nicaraguan officials said on Sunday that they would invite international experts to investigate the event further."
218,"The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven.

Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.'

The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine.

Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square

The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.

Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.'

The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society.

The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries.

Pet owners will welcome the Pope's remarks that their beloved dogs, cats, horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven

Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China.

The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China.

The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope.

But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops.

A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.

Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth

But it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

It's not the first time Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy.

The leader is seen as more liberal than his predecessors and his lenient positions on homosexuality and unwed couples have caused a stir in the conservative members of the church."
219,"Syrian activists claim militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized earlier this week a cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish fighters battling the extremist group.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the militants seized at least once cache, but may have seized more, the Associated Press reported.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Observatory, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said, “Team USA.”

But the badly-aimed weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The ISIS militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) and the Britain-based Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The air strikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamist rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against ISIS militants elsewhere in Syria.

220,"FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him."
221,"Updated at 11:45 p.m. ET

There was an unexpected crash landing near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital over the weekend, but luckily no one was hurt: A small meteor, thought to have broken off from an Earth-passing asteroid, left a 40-foot-wide crater.

The meteorite — which experts say may have disintegrated on impact — smashed through a wooded area outside the airport in Managua, leaving a 16-foot-deep hole.

""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria, a resident in the area of the impact, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.

The AP quotes Nicaraguan government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened, the AP says.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" Ineter scientist Jose Millan was quoted by the BBC as saying. ""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact.""

According to the BBC:

The asteroid was discovered on Aug. 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Ariz., and independently detected the next night by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, located on the summit of Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii, according to a NASA statement issued last week.

The statement said that on closest approach, the asteroid was to have been one-tenth the distance from the center of the Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles, away."
224,"'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard'

Not everyone at magazine publisher Condé Nast was thrilled on hearing the company was going to become the new flagship tenant of the brand new World Trade Centre skyscraper where the Twin Towers once stood. Some felt spooked by the tragic history of the site. They didn’t reckon on rats.

But one month after decamping from their old HQ off Times Square, the glamorous crews of titles like Vogue and Vanity Fair are waging a daily battle against a positive rat rampage. All employees have been banned from eating at their desks for fear of dispensing inadvertent treats to the roaming rodents.

Sources have told the Daily News that Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who likes a world of red carpets and sparkle not droppings and thick tails vanishing into cracks, has refused to show up in her office until the problem is bought under control.

While rat sightings are common in New York City’s ageing subway system, few would have imagined their invading a building as brand new and prestigious as One World Trade. But there they are, it seems, in ever multiplying numbers, happily scaling what is now the tallest building in the Western hemisphere.

""A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,"" one company source told the Daily News. ""They ate through his rug to fit under his door."" Another disgusted staff member told the paper that the rats at Vogue had essentially “taken over”.

It’s not quite the start that Graydon Carter, Editor-in-Chief, had imagined either. Ambushed by a Daily News reporter outside the tower he was asked whether the rats were a disgusting as everyone has been saying. “They’re rats,” he replied. “What do you think?”"
225,"The Indian government has sacked a civil servant who went on leave in 1990 and never came back to work.

Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a case of ""wilful absence"" had been proved against electrical engineer AK Verma.

Mr Verma had been under investigation since 1992, but had refused to co-operate, the minister said.

Correspondents say absenteeism is a pervasive problem in government-run offices in India.

Mr Naidu said in a statement that Mr Verma joined the Central Public Works Department in 1980.

He had risen to the rank of executive engineer by 1990, when he went on leave.

An inquiry was set up in 1992, but formal proceedings to dismiss him were not begun until 2007.

It took a further seven years for the department to reach a decision and dismiss him.

It is not clear whether he was paid during his time off.

Falling absenteeism

India's bureaucracy has become notorious for high levels of absenteeism.

A report in 2012 labelled India's government machinery the worst in Asia.

Schools have also faced problems, with teachers failing to turn up for work in huge numbers.

Last August, a state school in Madhya Pradesh sacked a teacher who had been absent for 23 years of her 24-year career.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to curb slack working practices when he took office last year.

The AFP news agency reports that he makes unannounced visits to government offices, and absenteeism has since plummeted."
226,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups.

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes.

Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death.

""While an extreme hardcore may fight over the leadership of al-Shabab, this is a chance for the majority of members of al-Shabab to change course and reject Godane's decision to make them the pawns of an international terror campaign,"" he said in a statement.

The Somali president said the U.S. operation was carried out ""with the full knowledge and agreement of"" his government and that Somalis ""greatly value the support of our international allies"" in the fight against al-Shabab.

Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, told reporters the success against al-Shabab should leave no doubt about his determination to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military announced later Friday that a mix of fighter jets, drones, attack planes and bombers launched four airstrikes Thursday and Friday in northern Iraq, destroying a host of Islamic State targets including an observation post, an armed vehicle and three mortar positions.

Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004.

""We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations"" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. ""That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.""

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008. The implications of the group's loss of Godane are unclear.

""The individual who takes his place will live in fear,"" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

Because Godane had weakened and effectively dismantled the al-Shabab council of leaders known as the shura, a meeting of regional commanders will have to take place to pick his successor, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden predicted the meeting will be difficult and dangerous to organize.

Terrorism analyst J.M. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.

Abdi Aynte, a Somali analyst who runs a Mogadishu-based think tank called the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that Godane's death ""will almost certainly be the beginning of the end of the organization.""

Under Godane's leadership, he said, al-Shabab had gradually become a guerrilla movement that avoided conventional warfare, tactics that suited it amid mounting military pressure from African Union troops and government forces.

Godane, who was born in 1977 and raised in the town of Hargeisa in the autonomous region of Somaliland, was said to be a quiet boy who was interested in the Quran and Islamic studies in his early years. His relatives there described him as ""a private man"" who was devoted to Islamic teachings at mosques, said Mohamed Hassan, a former senior Somali intelligence official in Somaliland who once was tasked with tracking down Godane over charges the future terror leader stole money when he worked for a local telecommunications company. In Somaliland, he also had been accused of involvement in the murder of foreigners.

Godane is believed to have settled in Mogadishu in 2004, working at local charities before he joined the Islamic Courts Union, al-Shabab's precursor group that once controlled Mogadishu and many parts of Somalia before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces.

227,"LAGOS — A wave of violence hours after Nigeria's government announced a truce with Boko Haram raised doubt on Sunday about whether more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamist militants will really be released, deflating the new hopes of their parents.

Nigeria's armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the ceasefire on Friday to enable the release of the girls, who were abducted from the remote northeastern village of Chibok in April.

But Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least five attacks since — blamed by security sources on the insurgents — that have killed dozens. Talks were scheduled to continue in neighboring Chad on Monday.

""We were jubilating. We had every reason to be happy ... but since then the ceasefire has been broken in quite a number of places already,"" Lawan Abana, a parent of the one of the missing girls, told Reuters by telephone.

He added that there were doubts about the credentials of the reported Boko Haram negotiator Danladi Ahmadu, who was unheard of before. ""Can we trust him that he can deliver on this promise of releasing the girls when he has not delivered on the promise of the ceasefire?"" Abana said.

The government says the attacks may not have been Boko Haram but one of several criminal groups exploiting the chaos of its insurgency. Analysts point out that Boko Haram is anyway heavily factionalized, so what matters is whether the faction the government is talking to has control over the girls' fate.

228,"Sex-selecting abortions are nothing new. They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don’t brag about them. At least they didn’t.

It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.

Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in “fighting for women’s rights” being all-consuming, “even to the point of eschewing a career.” Yet that lack of a career hasn’t stopped her from travelling to “many different places” to continue that “fight.

She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed “Assault” because the man sitting next to her said “B******* like you need to learn their place.”

Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That’s when she was told the only empty seats were “both back in economy.” At which point she demanded the man be moved.

When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn’t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.

The encounter left her “having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.”

That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. “By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,” she wrote.

Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she “had a good idea” who the father, or as she puts it, “the donator” happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the “gender” part would be up to the child. “I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,” she writes.

After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that “No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,” Lana got horrible news from her doctor – her baby had a penis.

She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, “My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.”

Within a few days she had aborted the baby. “My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,” Lana claims. “I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.”

Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of “a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.”

She ends her post with:

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.

The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.

At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first."
229,"The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com.

Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times.

And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous.

For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido.

But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers.

DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m

The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus

Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation

Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video

The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.

Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.

But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records.

Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.

They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.

They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour.

DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked.

Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida.

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.

They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.

One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'

The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.

The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme

'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.

'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.

'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'

His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.

'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'

Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.

'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.

Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.

When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.

'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.

But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.

She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'

While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.

Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live.

Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.

The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.

Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.

It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.

Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.

Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.

Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.

'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.

Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.

But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.

The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.

They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.

The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.

Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.

The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.

One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.

The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.

Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.

With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.

Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.

Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.

Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.

The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.

They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count.

In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.

Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.

The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.

The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.

A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.

The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.

Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.

He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.

Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'

Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.

But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando.

Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.

DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.

Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy.

According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.

She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.

On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.

'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!

'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'

In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.

It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'

Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto

Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector

But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away

Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.

Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.

The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.

One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.

'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'

Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'

Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.

Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.

It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.

Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.

Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.

Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography

Daily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls."

232,"Apple will offer a low power mode on Apple Watch to help boost it through longer days, according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute.

With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use.

Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort.

The report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary, Apple's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over 18 months ago, rather than at the last minute. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches.

The Times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the Apple Watch's development cycle, noting that Apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers, some of whom were poached by Google-owned home automation outfit Nest Labs. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year.

Chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world, for which Apple engineers created dummy casing, including some resembling Samsung smartwatches.

Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th. AppleInsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses."
234,"Christian Bale will not be playing Steve Jobs in the upcoming movie about the Apple co-founder, Hollywood Reporter reports.

Sources say the actor decided he wasn't right for the role, and withdrew.

This is coming after the movie's scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed that Bale would be playing the prickly tech icon, saying the actor didn't even need to audition.

No word if this'll affect Seth Rogan's negotiations to play Steve Wozniak, but this throws a huge wrinkle into the Danny Boyle-helmed adaptation of Walter Isaacson's critically acclaimed biography of Jobs. If they get desperate to bring Ashton Kutcher back into the turtleneck, we'll know things have taken a dark turn.

Who would you rather see play Jobs? I liked Bale for the role, but my backup choice is Stanley Tucci, if they can age him down somehow for younger scenes. Or Bradley Cooper, who has the right kind of nervous energy to spit out Sorkin's rapid dialogue. [via Hollywood Reporter]"

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

Sources close to the production being filmed in metro Detroit also said it wasn’t true that the Caped Crusader’s ride had been stolen.

Buzz about the supposed theft swirled Friday when at least one comic book website reported on the “scuttlebutt” that one of the Batmobile models had disappeared and was presumed stolen.

The rumor was greeted and retweeted with smirking skepticism by some — and insert-your-own-Detroit-joke comments by others.

The Warner Bros. production has been working hard to keep its activities under wraps while filming in and around Detroit. But that’s not always easy when the cast and crew leaves the relative lockdown of the film’s headquarters at Pontiac’s Michigan Motion Picture Studios.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile have been hitting the Web this week – an unwelcome reality for studios in a world where everyone with a smartphone is a potential paparazzi. Director Zack Snyder also tweeted an official photo.

243,"An alleged bug in iOS 8 appears to be deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without the user's permission.

Discovered by MacRumors after complaints surfaced from users of the blog site's forums, the bug is triggered by the option to Reset All Settings.

Found in the Reset screen under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to simply reset your iOS settings but leave your data and media untouched. Yet several forum users say that's not the case as certain iCloud documents also vanished after they reset all settings.

Based on user comments, the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, MacRumors said. One user reported that his iWork documents were deleted after resetting all settings, but other data files remained in iCloud.

""HELP,"" one user wrote. ""Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.""

""I just had this happen to me,"" another forum user wrote. ""I had a bit of weird behaviour on my iPad, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just reset all settings. For the hell of it, I did it on my iPhone as well. ALL DOCUMENTS LOST! How on earth does resetting settings (with a clear notice that data will not be lost) wipe out iCloud drive? It's embarassing.""

Apple's Time Machine feature is supposed to automatically back up your files so you can restore any that are lost. A couple of users said they checked Time Machine but were unable to retrieve the lost iCloud Drive files. However, a third person reported success with Time Machine, at least running the beta of OS X Yosemite. Several of the affected users say they've contacted Apple support personnel, who are investigating the issue.

MacRumors ran its own test on the bug and reported the following:

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive, and other cloud-based storage services. Beyond just syncing your files between your iOS devices and iCloud, you can directly store and retrieve documents and other files on iCloud Drive just as you can store and retrieve them locally.

244,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

“I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

Given the potency of Father O’Neal’s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

Taylor Lianne Chandler was born David Roy Fitch circa 1973.

While she was given a male name she is actually intersex which means she had male genitalia but no testicles.

At the same time she also has a uterus and no ovaries.

From a young age she knew that she was in fact female and started to dress as a girl.

Facebook   Taylor Lianne Chandler

In her teens she used testosterone blockers and estrogen enhancers.

During this period her name was changed – she initially changed it to Paige Victoria Whitney.

She left home age 15 and by 16 she became legally emancipated from her family.

When Taylor was 18 she got in trouble with the police twice – for a bad cheque and then a DUI.

The following year she revealed she “thought it would be smart to blackmail someone” into giving her money for her surgery.

But as soon as she got the money she was arrested and charged for extortion.

Taylor was forced to spend 30 days in jail – during which time she said she was ‘too ashamed’ to tell any of her family members.

Despite both her birth certificate and drivers licence proving she was female, she claims she was put in a cell with three men and was raped.

At some point in her twenties she underwent surgery to remove her male genitalia.

Since then she has campaigned for gender rights.

In 2001 Taylor was involved in an 'horrific' car accident which made her change her goals.

Following a lengthy recovering period she returned to school to study sign language interpreting - and did a two year ITP.

She went on to get a degree in social and behavioural sciences.

In 2004 her dream of opening an online consignment shop came true when she launched Chandler's Designer Consignment.

By 2013 she had found her calling in life - working in crisis management and has consulted on numerous hight profile cases.

In August 2014 Taylor says she met Michael Phelps via the dating app Tinder and they stared to start.

On September 30 2014 her relationship with Olympian Michael was made public and she rose to prominence.

By that time she had fell in love with the swimmer who checked into rehab in September after being arrested for DUI.

Taylor found it was too difficult to continue interpreting after she was in the public eye.

Since telling him she was born intersex she is worried she will lose him.

On 14 November she announced on Facebook that she was an intersex baby.

According to Wall Street Journal, Apple has “studied platinum watch casings,” which could be the material of choice for the luxury edition of the next-generation Watch. For the current Watch, the most expensive variant will boast 18-Karat gold plating. While Apple hasn’t revealed any details about the pricing, reports claim that it could go up to the $20,000 mark.

Considering that luxury watch makers like Rolex and Omega use platinum for their high-end watches, it seems like a logical step up for Apple as well. But the publication mentions that Apple has only been “studying” the materials, and this is by no means a confirmation about a platinum Watch variant.

254,"The right-hand man of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in Mosul.
An airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed at least two members of the group, including an aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry.
Reports that Baghdadi himself had been killed by a U.S. airstrike circulated in Turkish and Kurdish media Wednesday and were repeated to The Daily Beast by multiple Iraqi sources. But a Pentagon official denied that the ISIS leader was dead. ""There is no validity to the rumor that we've killed Baghdadi,"" a senior defense official told The Daily Beast.  

The Iraqi Defense Ministry announcement, first reported by al Arabayia, did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by American or Iraqi forces, but NBC News reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a U.S. airstrike. The article does not clarify whether the security official is American or Iraqi but quotes them as saying that three ISIS leaders were killed, including Baghdadi’s aide Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an explosives specialist and commander in the town of Tal Afar.

There have been no public statements yet from U.S. officials on the reported airstrikes.

While the U.S. air war in Iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early August, Thursday’s reports provide the first public indication that ISIS’s senior leadership is being directly targeted.

The rumors of Baghdadi’s death that spread through northern Iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide. It’s also possible that claim’s of Baghdadi’s death could have come from ISIS itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leader’s tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts.

Multiple sources, including Kurdish intelligence officials and former Iraqi army officers, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that Baghdadi had died somewhere in Syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing Iraq to seek medical treatment.

This was not the first time that rumors of Baghdadi’s death have surfaced. Without an independent press to verify new information, unverified claims can be spread quickly through Iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth.

But the new reports that ISIS leaders were killed by airstrikes in Mosul, coming only a day after a flurry of claims about Baghdadi’s death in Syria, suggests the group’s leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that Baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in Syria where President Obama has not yet authorized military intervention.

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis comforted a young boy who was distraught over the recent death of his dog by telling him, ""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,"" the 77-year leader of the Roman Catholic Church said, according to Time. ""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.""

The statement by the pope was welcomed by animal rights groups and humane societies across the globe, who see it as a repudiation of traditional Catholic teaching dating back hundreds of years that holds that animals can’t go to heaven because they have no souls.

""My inbox got flooded,"" Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States, told the New York Times. ""Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it.""

Some Catholic scholars, however, have warned that the Pope’s comment was made casually and should not be taken as official Church doctrine. Others point to earlier comments that seem to suggest that Pope Francis has long held beliefs that animals can go to heaven.

""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of  the Catholic magazine America, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""

The statement has also stirred up debate between vegan groups and their counterparts in the meat industry – with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) saying the pope’s statement aligns with the view of heaven as a peaceful place and could convince more Catholics to avoid eating meat.

""It’s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,"" said Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA. ""I’m not a Catholic historian, but PETA’s motto is that animals aren’t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren’t ours, they’re God’s.""

Pope Francis’ statement worried many in the multi-billion dollar meat industry, for whom the idea of Catholics not buying meat – especially those holiday hams and turkeys in the lead up to Christmas – equals a potentially large loss of revenue.

""As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,"" Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, told the Times in an email. ""They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.” 

Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given “dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.""

Father Martin couldn't see how the pope's comments could be interpreted as a proclamation about vegetarianism, but, he said, ""[The pope] is reminding us that all cre"

The story went that while Page, Jones and Bonham reportedly signed up immediately, Plant ripped up the papers right in front of his colleagues. Plant's publicist later debunked the report to The Guardian.

Scheduled to perform in London, Berlin and New Jersey, Branson was preparing to rename one of his jumbo jets ""The Starship,"" in order to fly the band to each of its destinations.

Via KSHB -41, Dr. Rex Archer, director of Health at the Kansas City Health Department said, ""this person was supposedly in Nigeria and had come here from there but we have no evidence that they were actually where any of the other cases were."" 
The patient had a 102-degree fever on Saturday night.

263,"A photo purporting to show the slain body of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appears to be a doctored picture of another slain militant killed in Syria in 2013.
Rumors circulated on social media and Iraqi media over the weekend that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago.
Later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

A picture purporting to show Baghdadi’s bloodied body in fatigues also circulated.

However, the picture appears to actually show Baghdadi’s head pasted onto the body of Sami Hafez Al-Abdullah, an Albanian national killed in Syria in 2013, according to an investigation by Storyful, a social media news agency.
A picture of Abdullah, who reportedly also served as an imam in Germany, and a report on his death appeared on Yemenite news site Hournews.net last year.

Despite the apparently doctored photo, Baghdadi’s fate, amid continuing American air strikes, remains unclear. 

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington’s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes — since the US air campaign began on August 8 — had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

“We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

“The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam — and the flooding that might result — would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,” he added.

ISIS fighters are being evaluated by the World Health Organization for the deadly virus. WHO is also checking a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad for others who may be infected, according to the New York Post.
Mosul has been under ISIS control since June 2014.
However, Iraqi newspaper Al-Sabah reported the fighters do have Ebola and are being treated.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus,"" ministry spokesman Ahmed Rudaini said. ""They are incapable to detect it."" 
Though some Iraqi news outlets have confirmed cases of Ebola, the country's health ministry has denied the reports. 
""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" WHO director Christy Feig told Mashable.
If the ill patients are determined to have Ebola, it would be the first time an ISIS-controlled area has the virus. ISIS does not believe in modern medicine or science, making it a potentially problematic situation. 
""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" said Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst for Levantine Group. ""In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""
In late December, more than a dozen Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers were being evaluated for the disease. A sample of the pathogen was taken from one lab to another, and mistakes made by technicians possibly exposed workers, according to the CDC."

""The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of 'Batman Vs. Superman' has gone missing, believed stolen.

The website is one of the known super hero movie sites and has been accurate in some of their scoops. However, there is no way to determine the accuracy of this claim except through the police.
One of the local radio stations affiliated with CBS Detroit Local did just that. The result along with CBS Detroit's report:
""Does this person - if the rumor is true (we don't know how credible the source is) - think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
If I see the Batmobile driving around anywhere I am taking photos. Even funnier: Could you imagine getting pulled over for going too slow in this car? No way right?
How would the cops catch it with all the Bat devices that come standard? Does Alfred come to your rescue? Is the Batcave set in the GPS? If so, you would be safe from the cops, I presume...

— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) September 13, 2014

Stills from the purported Haines execution video were released to the Internet Saturday, al-Jazeera reported. In the footage, a masked man claims Haines was killed because the United Kingdom said it would arm Kurdish fighters to combat ISIS in Iraq.

“This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State,” the masked men reportedly said, addressing U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage.

This time around, the message from the Islamic State is very much aimed at @David_Cameron, with a 2nd British hostage threatened.

â€” Brown Moses (@Brown_Moses) September 13, 2014

The UK Foreign Office is ""working urgently"" to verify the authenticity of the alleged Haines beheading video, Sky News reports. If verified, the execution would constitute ""another disgusting murder,"" the government organization said.

Haines’ relatives pleaded Saturday with ISIS to “make contact” and respond to their messages, NBC News reported. “We are the family of David Haines,” the relatives said in a statement. “We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

The British aid worker was identified as ISIS’ next target for beheading in the video which showed the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Militants vowed to kill Haines if the United States military did not end military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

A father of two, Haines was kidnapped in Syria while working with an organization that assists refugees from the country’s civil war, the New York Daily News reported. He was taken captive near the Turkish border."
271,"The Canadian government said on Sunday it was investigating reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish militias fighting in northern Syria has been captured by Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was “pursuing all appropriate channels” as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya’alon, said: “I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true.” The Shin Bet, Israel’s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: “There are no further details at this stage”.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. “They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,” she said.

On 20 November, a message posted to a Facebook page in Rosenberg’s name said: “My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx [sic] 2 weeks time on or around week of [8 December]. Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.”

Messages of concern were being posted on the Facebook page this weekend.

272,"A mother has been accused of cannibalism after she was allegedly found biting her newborn baby’s arm.

The woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, was found trying to eat the child while in a hospital ward in Shenzhen, southern China, recovering from the birth.

Luckily a nurse saw the woman with her teeth locked around her son and raised the alarm.

The nurse, named as Liu Tianlun, attempted to prise the woman off the baby but the mother refused to let her child go.

She was eventually sedated and extracted from the baby.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.

‘Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.

‘After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.’

The mother is believed to have been living on the street after being thrown out by her mother-in-law despite being pregnant.

She is believed to have been surviving on the streets for a number of weeks before going into labour and being taken to hospital.

Hospital staff are deciding whether to give the newborn back to his mother.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing."
273,"The Lebanese army detained a wife and daughter of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as they crossed from Syria nine days ago, security officials said on Tuesday, in a move seen as likely to put pressure on the Islamist chief.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported she had been detained in co-ordination with “foreign intelligence.”

A Lebanese security source said the arrest was “a powerful card to apply pressure” in negotiations to secure the release of 27 members of the Lebanese security forces captured by Islamic militants in August near the Syrian border – a view shared by other Lebanese officials who confirmed the arrest.

A senior Lebanese security official said al-Baghdadi’s wife had been traveling with one of their daughters, contradicting earlier reports that it was his son. DNA tests were conducted to verify it was al-Baghdadi’s child, the official said.

They were detained in northern Lebanon. Investigators were questioning her at the Lebanese defense ministry.

There was no immediate reaction from Islamic State websites, although some of the group’s supporters rejected the report.

Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics said the arrest indicated that the American-led coalition seems to have solid intelligence in Syria and Iraq.”

“I talked to a few people who told me this was a coordinated arrest between American intelligence services and the Lebanese army,” he told Reuters.

“If I were Abu Bakr Baghdadi, I would be very anxious that they are getting very close,” he said. “This is a development … that is very alarming for ISIS, in particular the top leadership.”

Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

A source with contacts with Iraqi intelligence said the captured woman was an Iraqi wife of al-Baghdadi’s, but could not confirm the name. There was cooperation between Iraqi and Lebanese authorities leading up to her capture, the source said.

Al-Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Islamic State has declared a caliphate and seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon’s neighbor to the east.

The Lebanese security forces have cracked down on the group’s sympathizers and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the borders with Syria. They have arrested over the past few months dozens of Islamic militants suspected of staging attacks to expand Islamic State influence in Lebanon.

A U.S.-led alliance is seeking to roll back Islamic State’s territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to “degrade and ultimately destroy” al-Baghdadi’s group, which is seeking to reshape the Middle East according to its radical vision of Islam.

An Islamic State fighter denied that al-Baghdadi’s wife had been arrested. “I have checked with our leaders and they said it was false news. The Lebanese are lying,” he said from inside Syria.

Spillover from the Syrian conflict has repeatedly jolted neighboring Lebanon. Militants affiliated to the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Islamic State are demanding the release of Islamists held by the Lebanese authorities in exchange for the captured members of the Lebanese security forces.

The United States is offering $10-million for information leading to the location, arrest, or conviction of al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai.

Al-Baghdadi called for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia in a speech purported to be in his name last month.

He said his self-declared caliphate was expanding in Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries and called for “volcanoes of jihad” the world over in the speech released on Nov. 13.

A CV of al-Baghdadi published on social media in July by Islamic State sympathizers described him as married but gave no further details.

Born in 1971, al-Baghdadi comes from an Iraqi family of preachers and Arabic teachers, according to a biography distributed on Islamist forums that says he studied at the Islamic University in Baghdad.

According to U.S. media reports, al-Baghdadi was detained for several years at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq, before becoming head of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, a predecessor to Islamic State, which expanded into Syria in 2013.

In June this year, his group named him “caliph for the Muslims everywhere,” and called on all Muslims to pledge allegiance. Although he is rarely pictured, a video released in July showed him preaching in a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

The Lebanese authorities have also detained the wife of Anas Shirkas, senior Nusra Front leader from Syria, security officials said on Tuesday. They did not identify her."
276,"Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman, who ISIS had claimed to have abducted, posted on Facebook Monday afternoon that she was “safe and secure.” On Sunday, contributors to a number of jihadist platforms had claimed that the Islamic State group had captured a “female Zionist soldier fighting with the Kurds against the Islamic State” from Kobani.

International Business Times was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.

Rosenberg, 31, who migrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, is believed to have served for two years in the Israeli military, according to a report by Haaretz. She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

""This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. ""We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.""

The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said."
277,"According the latest in a string of scoops from 9to5Mac, battery life has been a pressing concern for Apple throughout the development of the Apple Watch. And for the first time, ""sources familiar with the Watch's development"" have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year. In short, Apple Watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we've seen from many Android Wear devices on the market today.

Apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from Apple Watch. Obviously that's not all active use; in fact, the company is said to be shooting for 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use with the screen turned on. That'll vary depending on how heavily you use it, of course. But since the wearable's display will often be turned off throughout the day — and because the iPhone handles a lot of computing tasks — Apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night. 19 hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now.

THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO EXTEND A SMARTWATCH'S BATTERY LIFE

This isn't unlike what you'd get from the current field of Android smartwatches; use them constantly and they won't last a day. But that changes with more average use. Notably, the Pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life, but it's a very different device when compared against a Moto 360 or the Apple Watch. In standby and low-power modes, 9to5Mac's sources say Apple Watch can last through two or three days. And if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times, it'll die out after three or so hours. Using it as a workout companion? Your gym routine shouldn't last more than four hours.

Apple is reportedly testing Apple Watch's battery life aggressively — and in large numbers. 9to5Mac claims the company has distributed over 3,000 units as the development process continues. And while the iPhone is a critical companion to Apple Watch, the device itself may be more powerful than some expected. 9to5Mac says the CPU inside is more or less equally as powerful as the A5 chip that powered the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, and remains in the current-generation iPod touch. Considering the tiny form factor, we're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of iOS. But as for the battery, Apple can only do so much. The simple fact is that battery technology doesn't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists. The company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as Apple Watch's launch nears; it's expected to ship beginning in March."
280,"ISLAMIC State group jihadists are being trained by Saddam Hussein’s former pilots to fly three fighter jets captured from the Syrian military, a monitoring group says.

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the US and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of al-Qaeda which later became IS.

Meanwhile, sniper and mortar fire from jihadists are preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobane, a local official says.

At the same time, Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim, said US-led air strikes had destroyed many Islamic State group vehicles and artillery pieces, and that the town’s defenders are reinforcing their positions.

“There are civilians trapped in the centre and south of town, whom we cannot evacuate because of snipers and mortar fire,” Mr Muslim told AFP on Friday.

“Their situation is difficult.”

There are no precise figures on how many non-combatants remain in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab.

Last week, the United Nations spoke of as many as 700, mostly elderly, civilians being trapped in the centre of the town. Another 10,000-13,000 were said to be gathered near the Turkish border.

For its part, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are hundreds of civilians in the centre and west of town and that many of them refuse to leave, preferring to die than go into exile.

The IS jihadists, who have seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and declared a “caliphate,” first attacked Kobane on September 16 in a bid to seal their control of a long stretch on the Syrian side of the border.

They succeeded in taking nearly half the town before its defenders, aided by US-led air strikes, began pushing them back.

Describing the situation on Friday, Muslim said “you can see their bodies (IS jihadists) in the streets ... Our forces are reinforcing their defensive positions.”

The IS fighters are “mostly in the east and south, and have hidden their Hummers, artillery and tanks among the houses so as not to be targeted by the air strikes.”

He saluted what he called the “incredible resistance” of Kobane’s defenders, adding that the situation is still dangerous and that there is “no other choice but to resist.”"
281,"The wife and child of the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (Isil), have been arrested in Lebanon, security officials and Lebanese politicians said on Tuesday.

An Iraqi women, identified by local security sources as Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi was detained ten days ago at a checkpoint, along with Baghdadi’s son, north of the Lebanese town of Tripoli, a senior security confirmed to the Telegraph.

“She had crossed into Lebanon from Syria. She and her son were travelling on fake passports,” the source said.

The boy is said to be no older than 11 years of age.

Citing security officials, the Lebanese As-Safir newspaper said the child’s DNA had been tested and showed the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadist group is his father.

Baghdadi’s DNA is likely to have been taken by US officials in the American run Camp Bucca prison in Iraq, where he was detained in 2004.

The newspaper said the arrests had been made after a tip off from a “foreign” intelligence agency, that is believed to belong to a Western government.

The wife and child are said to be currently being held in the Ministry of National Defence headquarters in Yarze, just outside Beirut.

Mrs Dulaimi was one of 138 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Syrian nuns being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.

Though Iraqi, Mrs Dulaimi had reportedly detained along with three of her children during a military operation near the Syria capital Damascus.

Earlier this year a photograph was circulated online purporting to be of Mrs Dulaimi. It showed a young woman with a pale face, clearly defined cheek bones and large eyes. Her hair is covered in a black hijab.

The release of Mrs Dulaimi was repeatedly demanded by the al-Qaeda kidnappers of the nuns, who were captured from a convent in the Syrian Christian town of Maaloula.

One source close to the negotiations told the Telegraph that they had “insisted” that without her release negotiations “would not continue”.

Mrs Dulaimi’s second detention is likely to be a significant personal blow to Baghdadi and could be used as a bargaining chip against his group, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners and declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Syria and Iraq.

Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Earlier this year the Telegraph visited the ramshackle neighbourhood of Tobchi in Baghdad, where Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, spent his early years.

A resident who had played football alongside Baghdadi, when they were both part of a team formed by the local mosque, said he had married shortly after completing his doctorate at the Islamic University in Baghdad at the start of the millennium.

The resident, who asked not to be named recalled that his wife had given birth to a son within less than a year of the marriage ceremony. His son is now approximately 11 years old, matching the age of the boy reportedly captured in Lebanon.

There were some contradicting and unconfirmed reports that the child captured may have been a girl.

Syria's civil war has killed more than 200,000 people in less than four years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday."
282,"One More Thing … You Have to Charge It Every Day

“Bono really should ask Tim Cook about the Apple Watch’s battery life.” I tweeted that yesterday during the U2 frontman’s awkward vaudeville routine with Cook onstage Tuesday at Apple’s biggest event in years. We were clearly moments away from its end and we hadn’t been told how long the company’s first wearable will run on a single charge. Expected battery life was a glaring omission in an otherwise impressive parade of features and specs. And after ignoring it completely during the Apple Watch’s onstage debut, the company stalwartly refused comment on it during the device demos that followed.

There’s a good reason for that. Sources tell me that Apple isn’t yet happy with the watch’s battery life, which isn’t going to break any industry standards. “It’s about a day right now,” said one, adding that Apple is working on various modifications ahead of the device’s 2015 launch to improve it. Reached for comment, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris declined to provide an estimate on expected battery life, but said the company expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. “There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,” Kerris said. “We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”

283,"UPDATE: ESPN has confirmed that no such panel will take place, for the love of all that is holy.

Domestic abuse, a crime that victimizes 1.3 million women a year according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, is not an issue that men at the NFL seem capable of addressing, discussing, or addressing their discussion. According to the NCADV, ""In 70-80% of intimate partner homicides, no matter which partner was killed, the man physically abused the woman before the murder.""

It's men committing it, men not punishing them for it, men not losing their jobs over mishandling it. The end result has been some of the NFL's worst public relations, ever. But ESPN, a sports network that will stop at nothing to free the NFL of this shame, is about to step in and make it all better with a bold plan: Send in more men.

Eleven men, to be exact, who will fill out a panel prior to the Chiefs playing the Patriots tonight on Monday Night Football. The panel will discuss, among other things, domestic abuse and the NFL.

Remember, 1.3 million women are victimized by domestic abuse every year, but none of them will be on the panel. Ray Lewis will be, though. As will Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Stuart Scott and Steve Young. Esquire has a proper shaming here.

How have some of these guys reacted to Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson's domestic abuce scandals and Roger Goodell's gross mishandling of them?

""Look, the NFL did not create these problems. The people in the NFL created these problems. The players. It’s not the commissioner. It’s not the owners. These kids are given the opportunity to make a lot of money and to play football. Now, if they want to jeopardize that with stupid behavior and doing dumb things, then it’s their fault. Why should the NFL take a black eye for what individuals do?""

--Mike Ditka

""The only thing I'm proud about is the team I played for, they did the right thing. Take them off the field... Because you know what? As a man, that's the only thing we really respect. We don't respect no women. We don't respect no kids. The only thing Roger [Goodell] and them can do, take them off the field because they respect that.""

Carter's praising of the Vikings for heroically deactivating Peterson following his admission that he hit his child with a switch is a bit off, as the team had activated him to play that week. This was followed by intense public outcry and led to the Vikings then rescinding the activation a day and a half later. So yeah, they did the right thing, after enough people complained about them doing the very clearly wrong thing.

This is a lot of men who think a lot of things about these issues but they may not possess the eloquence needed to present their points. Although in somebody like Ditka's case, their points are wildly off base anyway. The best type of point we can hope for tonight is ""willful ignorance."" Why? Because, as Ben Collins writes in his Esquire piece:

""... ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.""

Mostly, though, the issue is this: On a panel choosing to discuss domestic abuse on the national stage, before an NFL football game, ESPN has filled out the roster with their extremely male water-carrying talking heads. And again, Ray freaking Lewis, who is no doubt being counted on for NFL Punishment Analysis and to discuss his long, hard journey back from being implicated in a double homicide to the unveiling of his statue in front of M&T Stadium. Their choice to talk about the issue is likely to be nothing more than further damage control, rather than an enlightening and frank discussion.

It will be very difficult to indicate that ESPN cares, and the NFL cares, and that you should care, if ESPN can't even take the issue seriously enough to find at the very least a female majority panel to discuss an issue that touches primarily women.

But it's okay, because Roger Goodell went to a domestic abuse call center, where he was very open about his plans to not forget about this issue as fast as he can.

""[Call center CEO Katie] Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL might put in place for domestic violence.""

286,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model."
288,"Islamic State (IS) fighters may have captured weapons airdropped by the US near the Syrian town of Kobane, intended for the Kurdish forces defending it against the jihadists' onslaught. 

A video posted on YouTube on Tuesday by a group calling itself ""A3maq News"" purports to show airdropped supplies in the hands of the extremist group. The footage shows a masked and armed militant examining a package attached to a parachute. Later, he looks into crates containing various munitions, including RPG rounds and grenades. 

The video could not immediately be independently verified, but A3maq News has previously posted IS-linked content and the some of the weapons seen in the video appear to match those possessed by Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which supplied the arms.

The grenades seen at 1:28 in the video are reported to be German-made. Berlin sent 10,000 grenades to Iraqi Kurdistan in August as part of a consignment of military aid provided to the KRG's peshmerga fighters, according to publicly available German government documents. 

Additionally, US Central Command confirmed in a statement on Monday that one airdropped bundle had missed its target,. However, CentCom said it had been destroyed in a follow-up airstrike to stop it falling into enemy hands. 


American C-130 planes delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the KRG to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters at dawn on Sunday, according to a CentCom statement. The operation was intended to ""enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,"" CentCom added, using the former name for the Islamic State.

YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil told Reuters that the weapons would ""help greatly"" in the fight against IS. ""The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,"" he said.

Kobane is surrounded on three sides by IS and is bordered to the north by Turkey. The Turkish government has thus far refused repeated requests to open a land corridor allowing humanitarian and military supplies into the town, leading to accusations of tacit complicity in the IS assault on the Kurds, whose struggle for greater autonomy has long been a thorn in Ankara's side. However, on Monday it announced that it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross the border to the town.

The airdrops were the first of their kind, but the US launched a series of airstrikes on IS targets in August, then extended operations into Syria in September. American planes have now carried out more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane, according to the Centcom statement, which it says are indicated to have ""slowed ISIL [S] advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions.""

289,"Finally, Pope Francis confirms what we've always known: All dogs go to heaven!
During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, the Catholic leader tried to console a little boy who was heartbroken over the death of his beloved pup. According to multiple reports, Pope Francis told the boy, ""One day, we will see our animals again the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.""
Of course, this viewpoint goes against the conservative Catholic ideology that because animals don't have souls (!), they can't go to heaven. Some theologians have cautioned, per the New York Times, that Pope Francis ""had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.""

Others within the faith, however, took the pontiff's words for what they were. ""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit persist and editor at large of America, the Catholic Magazine, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""
It's pretty clear, too, that Pope Francis is a friend to the four-legged. In fact, he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

292,"News of singer Axl Rose’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the December 2014 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, Guns N' Roses frontman is alive and well.

UPDATE 03/12/2014 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Axl Rose death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the singer’s alleged demise gained traction on Monday after a ‘R.I.P. Axl Rose’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American singer’s passing:

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Monday (December 01, 2014), our beloved singer Axl Rose passed away. Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962 in Lafayette. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 52-year-old singer, musician and songwriter was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Axl Rose's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (89%) of respondents think those Axl Rose death rumors are not funny anymore.

Axl Rose Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ‘Alive And Well’

On Tuesday (December 02) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Axl Rose is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe."
295,"Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”"
296,"When Apple unveiled its Apple Watch, the company said the starting price would come in at US$349, but insider sources are claiming the stainless steel version will start at $500. Those sources also say the high-end gold Apple Watch Edition will start between $4,000 and $5,000, which is lower than many have been expecting.

Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500

Assuming the sources are correct, that pegs the anodized aluminum Apple Watch Sport as the lower-priced $349 model.

The anonymous sources, speaking with the French site iGen (English translation), also said Apple will ship its smartwatch in time for Valentine's Day in February. While a February release would be nice because it would get Apple Watch on consumer's wrists earlier, doesn't fit with Apple Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts comments saying the smartwatch will ship in Spring 2015.

Apple Watch is a smartwatch device with sensors for tracking fitness activities and heart rate. It links to your iPhone to display alerts and messages, lets you reply to messages, shows turn-by-turn directions, learns your fitness routine and offers suggestions for improvement, and more. Three models in two sizes with multiple band options will be available when Apple Watch ships.

Hopefully Apple will release Apple Watch earlier in the year instead of some time in Spring, because even though products like Microsoft's new Band and Fitbit's just announced Surge aren't direct competitors, they are enticing enough to draw away some sales. Waiting until Spring could cost Apple some momentum, too.

iGen has been accurate in the past with Apple information, so they may be right on the pricing, but we're going with Angela Ahrendts on the release time frame because she's clearly in a good position to know when her own company's products will ship."
298,"Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect’s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Mr. Bibeau’s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

The suspect—who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec—has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal’s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

Parliament shooting

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Mr. Bibeau was on the West Coast.




According to British Columbia Court records, a “Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau” committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect’s time in B.C.

“The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,” wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. “Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,” he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Mr. Bibeau was a “high-risk traveller” whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Michaël Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

“You will have hate messages on your Facebook before long!!” wrote one of his friends, although as of Wednesday night nobody appears to have mistaken him for the shooting suspect.

Early Tuesday afternoon, @V_IMS, a French-language pro-ISIS social media account posted a grainy photo that was allegedly of the Ottawa shooter.

The image, which was apparently snapped from a TV screen using a cell phone, showed a dark-haired man wearing a scarf and holding a light hunting rifle.

Witness accounts from the scene say that the shooter was armed with a double-barreled shotgun.

According to reports from Ottawa Police, however, the shooter was armed with a 30-30 rifle, a caliber common to lever-action hunting rifles that would be consistent with the firearm held by the man featured in the Tweeted image.

The image remains unconfirmed, however, and Twitter suspended the account shortly before 5 p.m. ET."
299,"Young boy is seen holding guns in images circulated on social media

Isis supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as ‘martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child’s alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: ""That’s my boy.""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

The UN said: “In using children below the age of 15, the group has committed a war crime.”

News of the boy’s alleged death comes as video footage was released showing Isis firing on targets on the besieged Syria-Turkey border town of Kobani.

The video has been distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A’amaq, who publish clips showing the strategic assets seized by the group and where it is advancing.

In it, the fighters can be heard vowing to descend on the town in spite of coalition air strikes, with one warning: “We will enter the city and free it from non-believers.”"
300,"Apple took the leap into the wearable space with the announcement of its Apple Watch earlier in September this year, revealing that the device will start at $349. Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known."
302,"Every year, Apple does some counterprogramming at CES. This year, whether it meant to or not, it may have some big news: 9to5Mac has some new details that say there's a 12-inch MacBook Air with a completely new design, a higher-resolution display, and few of the trappings we've come to expect from a MacBook Air.

Here's Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac:

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.
According to Gurman's sources, there are a number of other changes as well. The function keys and arrow keys have been redesigned, and the keyboard sits completely edge to edge on the palmrest. It's smaller and narrower, apparently, and the trackpad doesn't have the same clicking feedback. Of course, let's be clear: these are leaks and sources, who are often working with incomplete and occasionally incorrect information. Things also change, a lot, between leaks and release. But also, Mark Gurman has a long history of being right.

These photos, too, are not real. They are renderings, guesses as to what the Macbook might be. But if these sources are right, confirming rumors we've been hearing for months and years — of a lighter, thinner, higher-res MacBook Air — 2015 could be a big year for Apple's laptops."

307,"Apple is reportedly planning to market and sell its Apple Watch much differently than its other products by allowing customers to book appointments to try on different watch models, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

New spaces will be added to Apple Stores specifically for this purpose, according to the report, which refers to this as a new ""shopping option.""

Salespeople are being trained to help customers pick out specific models.

This falls in line with what we've already heard regarding Apple's retail strategy for the Apple Watch. Last week, 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman revealed Apple's retail plans for the watch, which included having salespeople ask customers detailed questions about how they plan to use the watch.

Apple has emphasized the fact that it's selling the Apple Watch as a timepiece more than a gadget, so it's not surprising to hear that it's taking a different approach to retail. When it first presented the watch in September, it stressed that the Apple Watch is meant to tell the time before anything else.

It's the first new product category Apple has unveiled since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, and the company's retail strategy will also be telling of how Angel Ahrendts, Apple's new senior vice president of retail, is handling the job.

We're expecting to learn more details, such as pricing for more expensive Apple Watch models and availability, at Apple's event later today."
308,"Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.

There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have brought five years of havoc in Africa’s top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” said the head of Nigeria’s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa’s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is sinful,” has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria’s impoverished northeast.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

“Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

“There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.

Separately, Cameroon’s defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids."
311,"Islamic State insurgents released a video on Tuesday purportedly showing the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, who had gone missing in Syria nearly two years ago, and images of another American journalist whose life they said depended on U.S. action in Iraq.

The video, titled “A Message To America,” was posted on social-media websites. It was not immediately possible to verify its authenticity.

Mr. Foley, who has reported in the Middle East for five years, was kidnapped on Nov. 22, 2012, by unidentified gunmen. Steven Sotloff, who appeared at the end of the video, went missing in northern Syria while he was reporting in July, 2013.

A Twitter account set up by Mr. Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

The White House said that U.S. intelligence agents were working to verify the authenticity of the video.

Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The Sunni militant group has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria in areas it controls.

The video, which was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011, opened with a clip of U.S. President Barack Obama saying he had authorized strikes in Iraq.

“Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope toward a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen.

It showed black-and-white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask speaks in a British accent and says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression toward the Islamic State.

“Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement, he beheads the kneeling man.

At the end of the video, words on the side of the screen say “Steven Joel Sotloff” as another prisoner in an orange jumpsuit is shown on screen.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

Mr. Foley, a freelance reporter, had been covering Syria’s civil war for GlobalPost. In 2011, he was held for 45 days by forces loyal to former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Mr. Sotloff is also a freelancer journalist with published stories in Time Magazine and Foreign Policy. He has worked in Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Islamic State has executed hundreds of people in Syria and Iraq during its advance. Its members follow a hard-line interpretation of Sunni Islam but target all those who oppose it, including Sunni Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said Islamic State militants had executed 700 members of a Sunni tribe in eastern Syria in two weeks, the majority of them civilians.

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, referring to the militant group by an earlier name, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist, and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.”

Islamic State also released another video on Tuesday that gave the strongest indication yet it might attempt to strike American targets.

The video with the theme “breaking of the American cross” boasts Islamic State will emerge victorious over “crusader” America.

It follows a video posted on Monday, warning of attacks on American targets if Washington struck against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The latest footage spoke of a holy war between Islamic State and the United States, which occupied Iraq for nearly a decade and faced stiff resistance from al-Qaeda.

Unlike al-Qaeda, Islamic State has so far focused on territorial gains designed to eventually establish a full-blown Islamist empire."

NBC claims Seidel was merely “checking his phone,” which he had clumsily dropped in the snow. But there are a lot of unanswered questions: Why didn’t one of the PAs in the film crew grab his phone for him? Why has he been so reluctant to talk about the issue on Twitter?

322,"LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night’s Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.

Beck beat out both the night’s top winner, Sam Smith, and the category’s expected winner, Beyoncé.

The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swift’s “You Belong With Me” beat Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for Female Video of the Year.

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”

West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a “jackass” by no less than President Obama.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the ‘West boycott.’

No more Kanye West on live TV! And Beyoncé just lost her most loyal cheerleader."
323,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California -

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.

“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”

Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry - ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”

Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”"
324,"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

The top DHS official didn’t mention Hunter, a California Republican congressman, by name. But on several occasions, Johnson said that public officials have a “responsibility” to not “unnecessarily frighten the American public.”

“Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” the congressman said during an interview on Fox News, citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection, which is under DHS authority. Hunter also suggested that it was likely that “dozens” of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U.S.

On Wednesday, DHS flatly said that Hunter’s claim was unfounded. “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Judicial Watch reported later Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border in 36 hours.

Hunter’s deputy chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told POLITICO that the congressman stands by his statement, which came from a conversation with a “high-level” source, but didn’t elaborate when asked about the individuals’ specific ties to ISIL.

In September, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed that four men linked to terrorist organizations tried to cross the border earlier that month."
330,"British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the man suspected of the horrific beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to British media reports.

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

Key suspect: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary who raps under the name Lyricist Jinn. Photo: YouTube

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

In early August he tweeted a photo of himself wearing military camouflage and a black hood, while holding a severed head in his left hand.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killer, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

Murdered: American journalist James Foley. Photo: AP

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a ""significant force"" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting the Islamic State. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadists.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the manhunt. He is one of the British jihadists referred to by former hostages as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called ""George"" and ""Ringo"".

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of Britain's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Mr Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria."

337,"A propaganda video claiming to show U.S. journalist James Wright Foley kneeling on a mountaintop and making a long anti-U.S. statement, presumably under duress, was posted to YouTube on Tuesday. Foley is standing next to an ISIS militant, who makes some remarks placing the blame for Foley’s death on U.S. President Barack Obama, before appearing to behead Foley with a knife.

The video, posted by Furqan Media, an official ISIS outlet, begins with footage of President Obama’s speech announcing his authorization of air strikes against ISIS in northern Iraq, preceded by these words: “Obama authorizes military operation against the Islamic State, effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” The video, which gives no hint as to where Foley was being held, then shows footage of the recent air strike in northern Iraq, before cutting to the beginning of Foley’s speech.

In the statement, during which he remained calm, Foley appeared to date his remarks by referring to recent strikes in Iraq. He specifically mentioned his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force.

The militant at Foley’s side started his speech by saying: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” His statement referred to the recent air strikes, and continued: “You’re no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide, so effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership.”

Time magazine journalist Steven Sotloff, who has also been missing in Syria since August 2013, was paraded alive toward the end of the video, with the ISIS militant holding him threatening the U.S. president, saying that Sotloff’s life depended on Obama’s next move in Iraq.

Foley, a freelance journalist working for the Global Post, went missing near Taftanaz in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012, as he was on his way out of the country. His family and fellow journalists have been campaigning for his release ever since. Foley also spent six weeks in captivity in Libya while reporting on the war there in 2011. Numerous theories were posited for his disappearance, with many surmising that he was no longer alive, or that he was in Syrian state custody.

Jihadist forums immediately lit up with gloating posts upon the video’s publication, with exhortations to keep pushing the propaganda via social media. Said one, posting on the Hanein forums: “We must upload the video with a title in both Arabic and English for it to arrive to the American people … Keep uploading the video every minute since YouTube declared war on us you brothers.” Journalists and others, meanwhile, urged people not to share the video.

The original video was immediately removed from YouTube for breaching its terms and conditions on violent content, but multiple copies are continuing to pop up.

Several others pounced on the fact that Foley was shown in military-style fatigues during a split-screen portion of the video. “Look at minute 2:16, is he a soldier or a journalist!!” said one."

343,"A small furor has erupted over whether a Saudi television station blurred out the image of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in the broadcast of her and President Barack Obama’s meeting with new Saudi King Salman today in Riyadh. Saudi officials deny the claim.

The new king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but didn’t acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for King Abdullah. Barack and Michelle Obama cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral.  

Several videos posted on Saudis' Facebook pages obscured Michelle Obama's face. They were removed shortly after they were posted. I captured a screenshot of one such video before it was taken down. The Arab news service Mashahead posted on YouTube a video allegedly taken from the Saudi government television broadcast showing the blurred spot.

However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that ""Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred."" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama’s face.


 

The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.

After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.

According to the White House pool report, “Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.” In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.

""Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,"" Obama said.

344,"While child entrepreneurs have become increasingly common in the last decade, not many hit the lofty heights that 17-year-old “teen wolf” Mohammed Islam reached when his trading earnings reached the “high eight figures.”

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they’re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as “paralyzing,” and swore off the market thinking he just didn’t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones’ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort — called the “wolf of Wall Street,” another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

“What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it’s not just about the money.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.”

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he’s not old enough to move into.

The real “Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud. Hopefully the catchy nickname “Teen Wolf” can be re-imaged by the smart and tenacious teen from New York City."
345,"UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

""Not only do I get a Ruth's Chris gift card, but I got a three night's stay in the hospital."""
346,"OTTAWA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Canada is trying to confirm reports that a Canadian citizen has been captured in Syria, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday.

348,"One of the best things about the Internet is the speed at which it allows information to be shared. Unfortunately, this means all information -- even false ones like the news about the six-day darkness that would envelop the world in December.

The report ""NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014"" was published by Huzlers.com. Considering the site labeled itself as offering ""a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief,"" the story should have been taken with a grain of salt at the very least.

According to the story, NASA ""confirmed"" that the Earth would be experiencing six days of nearly complete darkness from Dec. 16 to 22. The event would supposedly happen because of a solar storm that would spur enough dust and debris in space that 90 percent of sunlight would be blocked out.

NASA head Charles Bolden was said to have made the announcement, asking people to remain calm given a solar storm so bad (the biggest in 250 years!) was going to happen that it would block out the sun for 216 hours.

Reporters also apparently ""interviewed"" people to hear what they had to say about the event, with Michael Hearns responding with a ""We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam.""

How people took that response seriously is a mystery.

Six days of darkness, if it were to really happen, sounds like a big deal but the story downplays it in the end, noting that officials said that major problems would not arise anyway. A certain Earl Godoy, a NASA scientist, reiterated there would be no problem because the planet could survive on ""artificial light"" during the event.

NASA has not made any official statements regarding this six-day period of darkness descending on Earth.

The good news is that this means the world will not be falling into darkness for six days in December. The bad news is that people aren't very good at separating what's real from what's not, liking and sharing the story thousands of times since it first came out on Oct. 25.

Huzlers.com was also responsible for reports in the past where Tupac Shakur claimed he was alive, Ebola victims rose from the dead, and Floyd Mayweather offered a $1 million annual salary to have someone read everything for him."

While neither Chastain nor Rogen have deals in place, the latter actor is in talks to play Wozniak, who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the mid-1970s.

Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing the film, which Sony has high hopes for, as it could be a major awards contender.

Rogen has proved himself more than capable of handling dramatic roles with his performances in “Take This Waltz” and “50/50.” Rogen's potential pairing with Bale has been compared to Martin Scorsese's decision to cast Jonah Hill alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which of course culminated with the actor's second Oscar nomination.

Rogen next stars opposite James Franco in “The Interview,” which Sony will release on Christmas Day. Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-directed the R-rated comedy, just as they did Sony's upcoming animated movie “Sausage Party.” Rogen recently wrapped Sony's untitled Christmas Eve movie, which reteams him with his “50/50” collaborators Joseph Gordon-Levitt and director Jonathan Levine.

Rogen is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

Chastain, who is simply being courted for an unspecified role and does not have a deal in place, previously starred in Sony's “Zero Dark Thirty” and is known to have a close relationship with studio chief Amy Pascal. She next stars in Christopher Nolan's “Interstellar” and will soon be seen opposite Oscar Isaac in “A Most Violent Year.” She's represented by CAA and Mosaic."
350,"If the past few weeks of nonstop media onslaught about North Korea and The Interview just haven’t quite appeased your insatiable appetite for Kim Jong-Un antics, fear not—there are other things (literally) cooking up his tunic sleeves.

Everyone’s favorite guilty pleasure, the sometimes-reliable, sometimes-not UK rag The Daily Mail, reports that the dictator is eyeing Scotland as the location for his next business venture—an expansion of the restaurant chain known as Pyongyang, which is owned by the North Korean government and used to generate additional cash flow overseas. There are currently franchises in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, Jakarta, and more recently, Amsterdam.

Although the proposed new location may seem a bit random, Scotland has allegedly been singled out for two reasons. The first is that Kim Jong-Un and other elite North Korean officials love drinking Scotch whisky. (His father, the late Kim Jong-Il, was a bigger fan of Hennessy, supposedly spending some £700,000 a year on the cognac.)

In September of this year when the United Kingdom debated whether or not Scotland should be granted sovereignty, Kim Jong-Un was allegedly a supporter of the country’s independence because—as Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of North Korean paper Choson Sinbo, told UK’s Daily Mirror—“North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so [Scotland and North Korea] can be beneficial to each other.”

In terms of the potential new addition to the Pyongyang chain, The Daily Mail claims that the other reason why North Korea might single out Scotland is that they want to make nice with some European countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image. North Korean Leadership Watch editor Michael Madden tells the Mail that Kim Jong-Un has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with Scotland ever since its bid for sovereignty, and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy European countries like England and France. Madden also claims that tourists in North Korea are already encouraged to pay tips in Scotch rather than won (the local currency).

Jenny Town of the US-Korea Institute is also quoted as arguing, “North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.” In this case, that may mean trying to snuggle up with a Pyongyang franchise that will attempt to win over the Scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish, kimchi, pine-nut gruel, dog meat soup, and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears. (Although these foods are served at other Pyongyang restaurants, there is no specific evidence that they’d make their way onto menus in Scotland).

There has been no official announcement from North Korea confirming that they are opening a restaurant in Scotland—in fact, a Korean embassy official recently denied the story to The Independent. But as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in North Korea, many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to Jong-Un himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the North Korean people.

Kim Jong-Un, 31, gained quite a bit of attention earlier this year for his diagnosis of gout, a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich, fatty foods. It was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to Emmental, more commonly called “Swiss cheese.”

No other details about the new restaurant have yet to be verified, so it’s unclear whether tipping in whisky would be encouraged."
352,"A former American soldier from Wisconsin who has become the face of the YPG Kurdish military force in Syria, told UPI Wednesday in an exclusive interview that civilians have been burned in an Islamic State attack, with injuries consistent with chemical weapons.

Jordan Matson, 28, a former U.S. Army soldier speaking from Derik, Syria, said his information comes from Walat Omar, the head field doctor in the embattled border town of Kobane, which is encircled by IS militants. Matson and others in the area said the injuries were caused by chemical weapons.

""Since I got the phone calls here in the location... I looked into it myself and after I'd seen pictures from fighters... from Kobane, I contacted the local field doctor on the ground in Kobane and he had sent me many pictures from the hospital,"" Matson said in his first video interview with U.S. media.

""We're trying to get a video camera to Kobane because they don't have one right now to record the injured and show the world proof of what's going on over there. ... We're making more attempts to have more solidified proof for the rest of the world.""

Omar posted photos to Facebook of visible burns that were reportedly sustained in the overnight attack.

Matson, a native of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, arrived in Syria last month via Iraq and quickly became the public face of the YPG.

""Someone had to do it,"" he said, laughing.

He is more serious in the widely publicized image of him clad in camouflage, a head scarf and carrying a weapon now appearing across YPG's social media accounts. Although the public role ""was thrown on me,"" Matson is quick to add he's happy to play it because the media attention has ""brought light to the situation here.""

Matson says American veterans are ""outraged"" over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.

""We do not want to see our brothers' lives be for nothing,"" he said. ""So, in the hundreds, veterans are lining up to come over here because if our government won't do anything, we will.""

Matson acknowledged that the recent U.S. airdrops of Iraqi-provided weapons to YPG fighters in Kobane are helpful in the battle against IS, but that more is needed.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked to explain U.S. support to non-vetted local fighters in Syria.

Earnest said that while there is ""limited insight into those particular fighters... the fact is, at this point, they are working hard to defeat ISIL forces that right now are concentrated on this specific community.""

""So we're going to evaluate each of these circumstances as they come along to look for opportunities to support local fighters against ISIL,"" Earnest said.

Matson said YPG needs more weapons and night vision goggles. The Islamic State militants, he said, fight primarily under cover of darkness and engage with YPG within 300 meters.

Night vision goggles ""would give us the ability to see them coming, organize our defenses and engage the enemy, and force ISIS to fight us at day because we would have a larger advantage.""

On Tuesday, the YPG launched a recruitment campaign. ""JOIN People's Defense Units/YPG/in Rojava, Syria, SEND TERRORISTS TO HELL and SAVE HUMANITY,"" reads the YPG's 'Lions of Rojava' recruitment message.

The page profiles American fighters, including Matson, who have traveled to Syria to join the battle against IS.

Matson encouraged his Facebook followers to consider joining the YPG, directing those interested to visit the newly established YPG recruitment page: ""For all those looking to join the YPG... send them a private message. They will explain what you need for your journey and will organize travel arrangements for you. Thank you all for your patience and god bless.""

It's unclear how many Americans are now overseas but Matson said Wednesday there are ""hundreds.""

Neither the U.S. Army nor the Pentagon would comment on the travel of former veterans to Syria.

The YPG has identified two other Americans who have joined its defense forces. Brian Wilson of Ohio, and Jeremy Woodard, a former infantryman from Mississippi.

Wilson declined to be interviewed.

Woodard's brother, Allen, expressed frustration with Jeremy's decision to travel to Syria. In a public Facebook post last month, he wrote:

""I talk to him almost everyday and still don't really understand why the hell he did go over there but he is there now and nothing I can do about it now. I just hope he makes it back fine. I think the military failed him this time. He never got the war and stuff out of him and the VA's mental health didn't keep a watch on him... His reasoning and excuses for going over there just don't make sense at all."""
355,"It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone.


A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated.""

Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation.

""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this.""

McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment.

""He was a little stunned,"" she said. ""Everyone was excited and you could kind of feel the energy in the room. This is the first time we've done anything over the top and this won't be the last.""

A group of Russians claim to have captured the best footage of bigfoot.

The adventurers spotted what they described as a hairy bear-sized humanoid that marched out of the woods before disappearing seconds later.

The recording came when a group of people from the city of Adygeisk set off in search of the mysterious creature after a local TV station reported that it had been sighted in a remote region.

They said they had questioned the people at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen the creature, and managed to get several independent confirmations that there was something out there.

CEN   Conclusive proof: A group claim to have spotted the beast in the woods

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local TV station said: ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.""

Another homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.

7 terrifying mystery beasts that never existed

""They were 5 to 6 centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.""

The local team then set off to investigate, and as they headed off into the forest said they were stunned when they heard the crunching of snow, and managed to grab footage of a hairy creature as it emerged from the trees.

After taking a plaster cast of the alleged footprint, the group have now handed their findings to local scientists for analysis.

The footage has already attracted a lot of interest with some suggesting it was just a stunt to bring in tourists, and others convinced that this was the first form of conclusive proof that the yeti exists in the area.

362,"ELON, N.C. – A recent rumor claims that Elon University has banned the term “freshman” because it’s sexist. But the rumor is not true, according to the university.

A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with “first year.”

The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.

The article claimed the school implemented the term “first-year” in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.

Anderson said the university uses the term “first-year” because it applies to more students than the term “freshman.”

He said the school uses “first-year” to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.

“Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ‘first-year’ more frequently because ‘first-year’ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,” Anderson said. “We still use ‘freshman’ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.”

The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word “freshman” to first-year.”

She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn’t put the school in a bad light.

Islamic State militants are launching bombs containing live scorpions as the latest terror weapon in Iraq.

Canisters of the creatures are being blasted into towns and villages, according to a British military expert who has just returned from the country.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, said: “It’s madness. IS have improvised devices to launch them.

""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

“Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

""Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.""

He said the 2ft bombs were not causing mass casualties but had a massive “psychological impact”.

Mr de Bretton-Gordon – of Avon Protection Systems – returned from Baghdad last week, where he was advising security forces.

Senior Iraqi officials reported the beasts were being used to target civilian areas in the north of the country.

The weapon harks back to the scorpions stuffed into pots and launched by Iraqis thousands of years ago – in 198 AD.

365,"A lot of folks are buzzing about 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior Mohammed ""Mo"" Islam who is rumored to have made $72 million from trading.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that they were going to ""make it clear on CNBC.""

366,"But an official says it would be ""irresponsible"" to identify the bodies as the missing students

A mass grave with an unconfirmed number of bodies was discovered in a part of Mexico near to where 43 college students were abducted, authorities announced Saturday night.

Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco said there was a connection between the burial site and the students’ disappearance from a teachers’ college the previous weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, Blanco said it would be “irresponsible” without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.

Mexico’s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.

The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.

Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country’s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.

Asya Abdullah, co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), who is in Kobane told Kurdish Question that a gas attack had taken place in an Eastern neighbourhood of the city tonight (21 Oct). Abdullah said that they didn't know where the gas had come from because there hadn' t been any explosions.

She said: ""It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighbourhood beforehand. Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment to do tests.""

Dr. Welat, one of four doctors in Kobane told Guney Yildiz, a journalist at BBC World that he suspected the chemical attack was either chlorine gas or phosphorous shells.

370,"Ignoring the idiotic instances where people intentionally started bending iPhone 6 units in stores just to prove it can be done, Apple did have an iPhone 6 Bendgate problem, which genuinely affected some early buyers. Early reports have shown that the iPhone 6 Plus was more prone to bending than its smaller sibling, with some users explaining why the iPhone 6 Plus can bend in a certain way — apparently the area around the bottom volume button lacks the kind of reinforcement that can prevent bending. However, Apple might have fixed the issue, one Reddit user seems to indicate.

Redditor doctorkuddles says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than his wife’s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.

“I can’t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,” he explains. “We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.

“First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (‘flicking’) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous ‘bends’ were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,” he adds.

doctorkuddles further says he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds “much more dull toned, indicating to me it’s more solid” whereas “her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow”

He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a “red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.”

Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.

“I just don’t see the memory being that much heavier,” he said.

No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it’s not clear whether doctorkuddles has actually discovered anything.

Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.

“It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,” iFixit’s mdjorie wrote on the same Reddit thread. “I don’t know what’s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn’t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.”

It’s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the Bendgate issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously and looks to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery."
371,"Bowe Bergdahl exited Taliban captivity in exchange for the U.S. releasing five jihadists to the government of Qatar, and now a U.S. senator claims those jihadists are “in touch” with an al-Qaida affiliate, which would confirm the fears of critics who objected to the deal made by the Obama administration.

CNN reported on January 29 that at least one of the five jihadists “has attempted to return to militant activity.”

“Several U.S. officials across different agencies and branches of the U.S. government have confirmed key details to CNN. The White House referred CNN to the Pentagon.”

CNN added that the U.S. allegedly believes this based on “an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar.”

Pentagon suspects detainee exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl attempting militant activity @barbarastarrcnn reports http://t.co/CWPGE3VWDF

— Barbara Starr (@barbarastarrcnn) January 29, 2015

The Associated Press provided a similar report, adding a named official to back up the assertion that the jihadists released for Bergdahl are now looking to return to terrorism.

“Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.”

Graham’s alleged assertions about the status of the five jihadists apparently is based on his visit to Qatar. The AP said that Graham “had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country,” although the Qatari government later assured him that all five jihadists remained in its borders, per the agreement with the U.S. government.

This latest news involving the terrorists exchanged for Bergdahl comes at a time when the Obama administration is dealing with rumors regarding the ongoing investigation into his conduct leading up to his capture.

The Inquisitr previously reported that some pundits and news outlets are claiming the government has decided to charge Bergdahl with desertion.

However, the U.S. Department of Defense flatly denies such allegations. Meanwhile, this denial has caused more speculation on how the unofficial allegations and official denial of those allegations might be part of an ongoing fight behind the scenes.

In fact, the Daily Signal argued the seemingly inconsistent “statements are not inconsistent.”

“Shaffer and Miklaszewski report that Bergdahl will be charged—ostensibly soon. Kirby is merely saying Bergdahl has not been charged yet. And by saying Bergdahl has not had charges referred against him, he is betting the press and public don’t understand the unique procedural steps in the court-martial process.”

The White House had not issued a statement on the latest reports regarding the alleged attempt of one or more of the jihadists released for Bergdahl to return to terrorism as of the time of the publication of this article.

372,"Multiple Iraqi and Kurdish media sources have claimed that some Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Mosul, Iraq, have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, Mashable reports.

The Iraqi outlets reportedly claimed that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital. The city, known as ISIS’s most important strategic stronghold in Iraq, has been under the control of the Islamic State since June.

Christy Feig, the World Health Organization (WHO) director of communications, told Mashable, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.” She said that WHO had reached out to authorities and asked if they needed help investigating the matter.

Kurdish media network Xendan reported that ISIS jihadists’ symptoms were similar to those shown by someone who has contracted Ebola. However, it is highly uncertain whether Mosul health authorities have the means, tools, or skill-set necessary to test for Ebola, given the current hostile environment in the area.

In late December, the Islamic State reportedly executed doctors who refused to treat their militant jihadis. The Washington Post said of the ongoing situation in Mosul, “Services are collapsing, prices are soaring, and medicines are scarce in towns and cities across the ‘caliphate’ proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by ISIS.”

Iraq’s pro-government Al Sabaah (The Morning) daily newspaper reported that Ebola made its way into Mosul through Africa-based Islamist “terrorists” who then linked up with ISIS. Mashable notes, however, that the majority of ISIS recruits in Africa have come from countries that have not reported any Ebola cases, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, and others.

Meanwhile, Mosul’s liberation remains a strategic priority for Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. Mosul has been described as ISIS’s de facto capital in Iraq. While under ISIS control, many of the city’s one million residents have lived under fear of severe punishment or execution should they not comply with the jihadists’ mandates."

He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

The author, known only as Lena, said in her blog that she was ready to have a child but because of her ""bad experiences with men"" she had an abortion when she discovered the baby's sex, the Metro has reported.

In the blog she says she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ‘the donator’.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women’s rights ""to the point of eschewing a career"".

The woman wrote when she found out she was having a boy, she was ""in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with"".

She continued: ""A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch...I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.""

The blogger says she went on to give birth to a ""beautiful"" baby girl.

She says: ""I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.

""I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

""I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

""If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.""

But her comments have triggered a backlash online and speculation as to whether her comments are genuine.

Sex selection abortion is expected to be made officially illegal in the UK under an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which has the backing of 70 MPs.

The bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and is intended to clarify the law on sex selective abortion.

It also contains new measures to combat domestic violence and female genital mutilation (FGM).

An alliance of faith and women's groups representing Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus has backed the amendment and said ""not enough is being done"" to stop the practice, the Daily Telegraph reported today."
375,"The Boston Globe’s Boston.com last night pulled a story off its website that alleged a Harvard Business School professor had sent “racist” emails to the owner of a Chinese restaurant with whom he had a dispute over $4 on his bill.

Boston.com has taken professor Ben Edelman to task over the dispute in a series of stories. Last night, the website posted a story headlined: “Ben Edelman Appears to Have Sent Racist Email to Chinese Restaurant Owner. Today.”

“Could it be Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman has a problem with people of Asian descent?” the story said. It also included what purported to be the text of emails from Edelman containing a racial slur, which Boston.com said had been provided to the website by the restaurant owner.

Edelman has reportedly denied sending such an email.

He could not be reached for comment by the Herald last night.

The Boston.com story, which gained significant traction on the Internet, was replaced by an editor’s note that reads: “Earlier tonight, Boston.com published a piece suggesting Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman sent an email with racist overtones to Sichuan Garden. We cannot verify that Edelman, in fact, sent the email. We have taken the story down.”"

377,"SEOUL — Early signs yesterday indicated that Mr Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has been absent from public view for more than a month, skipped an important annual ritual, which was likely to fuel further speculation about his whereabouts and even his grip on power.

Yesterday was the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Since taking over the top leadership position after the death of his father, longtime ruler Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, the younger Kim had marked the beginning of this important national holiday by leading top military and party officials on a midnight visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum in Pyongyang.

By Friday morning, the state-run media had made no mention of such a visit, which would have taken place at midnight on Thursday. The gigantic Kumsusan Palace of the Sun — where the mummified bodies of Mr Kim’s father and his grandfather, the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, lie in state — is among the most sacred places in the country.

During the anniversary last year, Mr Kim and his wife also attended the performance of a national choir and the dedication of new buildings. If he did the same this year, the news would probably have been reported in the North Korean media. No public appearance by the leader has been shown in the media since Sept 3.

Speculation escalated after the state-run Korean Central Television confirmed that Mr Kim was not feeling well and showed him limping during a visit to a factory in August. He was first seen limping on North Korean television in July.

While he was absent from public view, Mr Kim continued his work, sending letters to young party cadets and workers, state media said.

South Korean officials and analysts have said the young and obese North Korean leader may be suffering from health problems, such as gout. One Seoul-based website, run by North Korean defectors, recently reported that many of Mr Kim’s daily duties had been taken over by his younger sister, Ms Kim Yo-jong, while he was being treated for health issues caused by his excessive eating and drinking.

A source with access to Pyongyang’s leadership said on Thursday that Mr Kim is in firm control of his government, but had hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises, reported Reuters. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said: “He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.”

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning, but the injury worsened,” the source told Reuters.

But on the Internet, bloggers were spreading rumours, with no evidence, that Mr Kim, believed to be about 30, might have been sidelined by a coup engineered by some of the old disgruntled generals. AGENCIES"
379,"A teacher who reportedly had sex with a 16-year-old pupil who secretly took a video of the tryst may have been the victim of a vicious internet prank.

Various media reported that Lucita Sandoval, a 26-year-old teacher from the city of Santiago del Estero, in north-central Argentina, was facing disciplinary action over the video.

It now emerges the teacher in the video isn't Sandoval, but an entirely different woman from the city of Corrientes.

Nuevo Diario tracked down the man in the video, who isn't an underage student but is actually in college.

It was also falsely reported the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils.

The video was posted on a pornography site in September.

Mystery still surrounds where the story emerged from, and why Sandoval was targeted in this way.

381,"“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

382,"Fox & Friends got very excited Thursday morning over rumors, which they credited to Jordanian TV, that King Abdullah of Jordan had potentially participated in retaliatory airstrikes against ISIS after the immolation death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

“What a statement that would make,” Steve Doocy said.

“He is stepping up with strong leadership and clarity,” Elisabeth Hasselbeck said. “What is our president doing?

Fox aired photos of of King Abdullah in flight gear, which had been making the rounds on Twitter since Wednesday evening:

Al Arabiya confirmed that Abdullah did not take part in any air strikes, and contradicted Doocy’s statement that he was a pilot:

Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets – indicated he is set to do so. The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force. The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

Doocy quietly corrected he record at the end of the next segment. “By the way, I should point out we understand that so far the king has not taken part in any of the raids,” Doocy said. “But he may going forward.” What a statement that would make.

383,"The sale of a private island in Lake Mälaren has received international attention, thanks to the assertion that it is Tiger Woods who sells it. But that's not true - the true owner is a Swedish millionaire.

""If you have 45 million over and want to buy tiger woods house on an island in Lake Mälaren? Then it exactly right now you have the chance. ""

Thus wrote radio station Mix Megapol programs last morning on Facebook on January 8, and linked to an object in the broker real estate agency. Anyone who clicked on the link found the island of Great Rullingen, a luxurious island dream equipped with everything from wine cellars to the ancient castle.

At last morning's mail was shared over 300 times, and it was not just those who let themselves be impressed by the island. Even internationally the news that golf star Tiger Woods is now selling its Swedish island become widespread - it is published by the British The Telegraph and the Daily Mail , US New York Post o ch LA Times , and Yahoo .

The only problem with the story is that Göteborgs-Posten drew attention already January 9, that the island is not at all belong to Tiger Woods. It says Johan Vesterberg on estate agency, who do not know how it is that the data started to circulate.

- We have had this island for sale in a few months, and it started to pop up articles around the world that it was Tiger Woods who owned it. How it has started, we have no idea, says Vesterberg.

In several articles written about the island quoted a Sabine Rollinger, an employee of the broker Vladi Private Islands. To The Telegraph, she says for example that Woods took the island, but that after his divorce with Swedish exhustrun Elin Nordegren ""did not need it anymore.""

But when Viral Inspector reaches Rollinger she writes in an email, ""to avoid misunderstanding"" that the island is not owned by Tiger Woods, but by a ""Swedish millionaire"".

- He has commissioned us to sell it for him. As we understood it was designed originally for Tiger Woods and his wife. When their marriage suddenly ran out, he needed, however, it no longer writes Rollinger in an email.

It rejects, however, Johan Vesterberg on estate agency.

- It is not owned by Tiger Woods, and what we know, he has never owned it. The present owners have built it on the island now, and he did not for Tiger Woods, but for my part, he says.

It's not the first time that Big roll no is up for sale. Already in 2011 attracted the attention of the media when it could be sold for 75 million. However, there was no one who bought the island at the time, and now the price has thus been reduced by 30 million.

If you are conspiratorially inclined, of course, think it is very appropriate to task about Tiger Woods now gives the sales international attention. But that's not the broker real estate agency who planted the story, at least not according to Johan Vesterberg.

- It is definitely not a negative to get noticed in this way. It is not no way we're working on, but we will not say no to the attention even if it is not true, he says."
384,"What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 

The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""

Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson. 

Here is the segment as it aired on CNN with the audio recording:"
385,"Rome| An Italian expert studying a first century document written by the Roman historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus that was recently discovered in the archives of the Vatican, found what is presumed to be the first eyewitness account ever recorded of a miracle of Jesus Christ. The author describes a scene that he allegedly witnessed, in which a prophet and teacher that he names Iēsous de Nazarenus, resuscitated a stillborn boy and handed him back to his mother.

Historian and archivist Ignazio Perrucci, was hired by the Vatican authorities in 2012, to sort, analyze and classify some 6,000 ancient documents that had been uncovered in the gigantic archive vaults. He was already very excited when he noticed that the author of the text was the famous Roman historian Velleius, but he was completely stunned when he realized the nature of the content.

Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era.

The text as a whole is a narrative of the author’s return journey from Parthia to Rome that occurred in 31 AD, recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment. He describes many different episodes taking place during his trip, like a a violent sandstorm in Mesopotamia and visit to a temple in Melitta (modern day Mdina, in Malta).

The part of the text that really caught M. Perrucci’s attention is an episode taking place in the city of Sebaste (near modern day Nablus, in the West Bank). The author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers, causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them. According to Velleius, that great man’s name was Iēsous de Nazarenus, a Greco-Latin translation of Jesus’ Hebrew name, Yeshua haNotzri.

Upon entering town, Jesus would have visited the house of a woman named Elisheba, who had just given birth to a stillborn child. Jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in Aramaic to the heavens, which unfortunately the author describes as “immensus”, meaning incomprehensible. To the crowd’s surprise and amazement, the baby came back to life almost immediately, crying and squirming like a healthy newborn.

Marcus Velleius Paterculus, being a Roman officer of Campanian origins, seems to perceive Jesus Christ as a great doctor and miracle man, without associating him in any way to the Jewish concept of Messiah.

Many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript. The composition of the parchment and ink, the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate. The dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written, does indeed date from the 1st century of this era, more precisely from between 20-45 AD.

This new text from an author known for his reliability, brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is Jesus of Nazareth. It comes to confirm the Gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people.

A complete and official translation of the document should be made available online in many different languages over the next few weeks, but the impact of the discovery is already felt in the scientific community. Many scholars have already saluted the finding as one of the greatest breakthrough ever realized in the study of the historical life of Jesus, while others have expressed doubts about the conclusions of Professor Perrucci and demand for more tests to be performed by other scientific institutions before drawing any conclusions."

387,"(Nov. 26, 2014) – Your Thanksgiving turkey is perfectly safe. There is no nationwide turkey recall. You don’t have to worry about an Ebola-infected bird.

Both of those rumors spread this month across social media.

The fake turkey recall first appeared on a satirical website called “National Report.” The article quoted the CDC as saying millions of turkeys were unsafe because of avian flu.

The USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service went on Twitter to debunk the hoax, saying the agency would post any real recalls on its website.


Snopes.com—the premier debunker of internet myths—said the article was fake.

And the folks at Snopes.com have been talking turkey plenty this month.

On Nov. 10, a website posted an article claiming more than 250,000 turkeys at a Texas turkey farm had been infected with Ebola. The article claimed an employee had been on the job for three days after experiencing Ebola symptoms and potentially contaminated several turkeys.

The turkey farm—“Texas Prime Turkey Farm”—doesn’t exist anywhere in Texas, Snopes.com found. In addition, the website that posted the story (“Daily Buzz Live”) frequently spreads outrageous stories and false claims."

A boy who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a huge electrical shock claims he has become a LIVING MAGNET with superpowers like those of Marvel's Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire.

""When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened,"" he said.

""When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

""Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""

Europics   'Superpowers': Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it,"" he said.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

""Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.""

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

Europics   Look at me: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko 'performs' for his classmates

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: ""I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Europics   Cutlery collection: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko is a magnet for spoons and coins

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV.

The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin.

390,"According to The Washington Post, Emwazi grew up in a well-to-do family in west London. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the militant group.

He is said to have graduated from college with a degree in computer programming at the University of Westminster.

The militant has appeared in a series of videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, were brutally murdered.

""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"" said one of his close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. ""He was like a brother to me... I am sure it is him.""

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos: ""There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

'Counter-terrorism'
Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

From Britain to Syria via Kuwait, Tanzania and the Netherlands
Emwazi is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait. Growing up in west London, he was described as a ""polite, mild-mannered"" man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.

It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi's life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.

The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and returned to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

An article in The Independent in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.

He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.

Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.

His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist James Foley in August, dressed in black with only his eyes visible. He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British charity worker Alan Henning.

British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning's developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation."""

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group.

'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.'

CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.'

The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally.

Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim.

“The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement.

'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.'

Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency.

During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'

But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S.

'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.'

'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have.'

'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?'

'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.'

The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.

Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'

Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border.

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.'

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.'

The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.

The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.

'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said

'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network."
394,"An unverified photo claims to show the body of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he was purportedly killed by US air strikes against three senior members of ISIS. An aide to al-Baghdadi were also killed by US air strikes.

The ISIS leader was reportedly killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer.

Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

A number of news outlets and websites have published the unverified photo and news about the death of al-Baghdadi by US airstrikes. IraqiNews.com has been unable to verify the photo and claim that al-Baghdadi was killed."
395,"New York City—a generally liberal city whose marijuana laws have remained notoriously strict even as drug policies have been reformed in other areas of the country—may begin instructing police officers to issue tickets to individuals found in possession of marijuana rather than arresting them. The New York Times' Joseph Goldstein has the scoop:

People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.

The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the department’s excessive stop-and-frisk practices.

Key questions about the policy remain unanswered, the Times reports, including whether public use of marijuana will be treated the same as possession and whether marijuana tickets will be recorded on citizens' criminal records."
396,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and Western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on Sept. 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The official noted that the reports also come three weeks before the second anniversary of the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.


A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners. A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.

The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft after the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies."
397,"No less than seven school girls fell pregnant during a five day school trip recently.

Parents of the girls, who are aged between 13 and 15-years-old, are furious at the school and say the children were not properly supervised.

The girls, from the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, were in the capital of Sarajevo to visit Museums and historical sites.

While the parents are angry at the school administrators, the teachers say the blame lies with the parents, who they claim have failed to teach their children about safe sex.

The case has reignited an ongoing national discussion in Bosnia concerning the worrying increase in teenage pregnancies.

398,"(CNN) -- Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Will autopsy shed any light on what happened?

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""

399,"A religious cleric in Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa ruling forbidding the building of snowmen.

Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid was asked whether it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for children after a snowstorm in the country's north. His response:
It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.

– SHEIKH MOHAMMED SALEH AL-MUNAJJID
Quoting Muslim scholars, he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, which is considered sinful under the country's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

The ruling does open up the possibility of the building of a snowapple.
God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.

– SHEIKH MUNAJJID
The fatwa comes after a number of social media users from Saudi Arabia have been posting images of snowmen and camels online, and has prompted lively debate. One user who appeared to take umbrage at the fatwa said:
A people looking for a fatwa for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa

– TWITTER USER
Whilst another praised the cleric for ""recognising matters even Satan does not think about"".
It is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism. May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about."
401,"Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene.

Even by the standards of Google’s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office.

The purchase — which could close later this month — would be Mountain View-based Google’s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant’s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network.

Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment. I’m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it’s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said.

“If any deal is done by anyone, we’d welcome them to Redwood City,” Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he’d wait to comment on Google’s potential arrival until a deal is complete.

Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings — which are more than 90 percent leased — would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots.

“It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there’s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,” said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City.

The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City.

“This is one more thing,” Grant said. “We’ve always been thought of as, ‘Maybe, but I’d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.’ Suddenly, the middle maybe isn’t a bad place to be.”

Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood’s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records.

The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at “substantially more” than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012.

One of the Valley’s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago.

A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

“All things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,” said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. “You could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.”

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores.

""I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,"" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. ""This might be one way to address it.""

San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said.

A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said.

""If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,"" Connolly said. ""We could be very creative about working this out.""

If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google’s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley — it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale— means it’s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus.

The current and future Google growth ""(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,"" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. ""It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.""

The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

This is the head of NASA Charles Bolden who made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. This will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total. Reporters interviewed a few people to hear what they had to say about the situation with Michael Hearns responding “We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam”.

Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything. “We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all”, says NASA scientist Earl Godoy.

405,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was known as 'L Jinny' as a rapper

Saturday 23 August 2014

A former rapper fighting with the Islamic State (Isis) in Syria is believed to be one of several British jihadists under investigation following the beheading of James Foley.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, was known as L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn at home in London, where his rising music career saw him appear in videos and have his singles played on BBC Radio in 2012.

He came to national attention earlier this year, when he posted a picture of himself holding a severed head on Twitter after resurfacing in Syria.

The gruesome picture, believed to have been taken in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, was captioned: “Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him.”

Bary reportedly travelled to the country last year from Maida Vale, west London, where he lived with his mother and five siblings.

His father Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee thought to be one of Osama Bin Laden’s closes lieutenants, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 for his alleged roles in the bombings of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998.

His family is frequently mentioned in rap songs that are still floating around the internet, with many people, unaware of L Jinny’s macabre transformation, praising his lyrics.

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (“roll up and watch the leaves ignite”) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

Many British jihadists are known to be in Syria, including these men featuring in an Isis video to urge Islamists in the West to join them  The most recent video, which was posted on YouTube in March this year, is called “The Beginning”.

“Give me the pride and the honour like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,” Bary raps.

“Imagine then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I’m wishing you were dead, violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

Bary’s current whereabouts in Syria is not known and his Twitter account under the name “Terrorist” @ItsLJinny has been deactivated.

Previous posts mentioned Abu Hussein al Britani, a fellow Isis militant who has uploaded pictures of himself on Twitter with guns in Syria.

He and associate Abu Abdullah al-Britani were seen offering travel advice to would-be jihadists online earlier this year.

The Sun newspaper has linked the trio to a group of British jihadists known as “The Beatles”, including the man known as “John” who beheaded American journalist Mr Foley.

In pictures: James Foley

A sound expert who compared the footage of the brutal killing with Bary’s rap songs told the paper there was a “big likeness” between the voices.

Mr Foley’s murderer has not been identified by authorities but the Foreign Secretary said he sounded British and experts were urgently trying to trace him.

Police are believed to be preparing for raids on several homes across Britain in efforts to trace “jihadi John” but a spokesperson for the Counter Terrorism Unit at Scotland Yard would not confirm the identities of any suspects."
406,"According to the latest research from our WDE (Wearables) research service, the Apple Watch smartwatch will ship 15 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world’s number one smartwatch vendor with 55 percent global marketshare this year.

We forecast total global smartwatch shipments to grow 511 percent from 4.6 million units in 2014 to 28.1 million units in 2015. Most of the smartwatch growth will come from the new Apple Watch, which we forecast to ship 15.4 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world’s number one smartwatch vendor and capture 55 percent global marketshare this year.

The Apple Watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market. Apple’s famous brand, loyal fan base, deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its Watch. However, Apple’s first-generation Watch is not yet perfect. For example, Apple’s Watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the Huawei Watch, battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to, and Apple’s premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers. Apple will need to upgrade tangibly its second-generation Watch to stay ahead of competitors later this year."
407,"The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a ""black hole"" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation."
409,"Over the weekend, the Canadian police force of Newfoundland and Labrador posted a “wanted” status on Facebook looking for Rodney Constantine, a man wanted for assault and some outstanding warrants.

Apparently, Rodney Constantine himself commented on the post and is planning to turn himself in.

Constantine let police know he’ll be coming in “Monday morn,” but the RNC police politely reminded him that their facilities are open 24/7.

What proceeded was a weird and hilarious correspondence between police and Constantine in the comment section.

The RNC police told BuzzFeed News that they believe this is their guy, but he has yet to physically turn himself in.

“It’s hard to say if the person we found is the person, but it certainly seems that way,” Media Relations Officer Steve Curnew told BuzzFeed News.

Curnew also explained that they only turn to their social media outlets as a “last resort” if they can’t locate them by addresses on file. While police are hopeful they have the right Rodney Constantine, “no one by that name has turned themselves in yet.”

This is not the first or even second time a suspect has identified themselves to Newfoundland cops on Facebook.

Curnew says he’s not surprised Constantine has so casually commented on his own wanted post on Facebook — this has been the case at least twice before. “We’ve had it happen on one or two occasions that a person has contacted us,” Curnew explained to BuzzFeed News. “When you send it out on social media, word comes around quick.”

He also pointed out that Constantine might not have known he was even wanted.

“The person sometimes isn’t aware they have outstanding warrants. [He] may have just become aware that police are looking for him and he has nothing to hide.”

Meanwhile, Newfoundland residents still can’t quite get over it.

The Corsicana Daily Sun reported that local emergency management officials, the Corsicana-Navarro County Public Health District and county officials all say there’s no truth to the claim that federal officials closed down the town of about 130 residents.

""A release today on at least one website, National Report, stated that “The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus. This report is entirely false,” Navarro County Judge H.M. Davenport said in a statement.

""Local authorities, emergency management, and county government have been inundated with calls concerning this false report. Please be assured if this were accurate information, you would have been notified immediately from accurate sources first,” Davenport said.

""Please ensure that you utilize accurate information sources when looking on social media and any unknown news sources,” Davenport said."
413,"OK, so the robot apocalypse probably won’t happen any time soon, but the new robot sentries guarding Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus seem like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie.

According to ExtremeTech, each of the K5 security guard robots from robotics company Knightscope stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds, so you probably don’t want to mess with one.

The K5 robots don’t come with any weapons onboard—thankfully—but they use a suite of alarms, sirens, and cameras to monitor and patrol the grounds of Microsoft’s campus. If one spots trouble, it’ll either sound an alarm or dispatch a human security guard to its location. 

ExtremeTech notes that the K5 can run for up to 24 hours on a single charge, and can recharge in only about 20 minutes. Its battery won’t die out in the field, though—these bots will return to the charging station by themselves when their batteries start to run dry.

The story behind the story: Robots are playing an increasingly large role in security and military operations. Google-owned robotics company Boston Dynamics, for example, has been working with DARPA to develop various robots to aid soldiers in combat settings. Meanwhile, South Korea deployed a robotic sentry to guard its side of the Demilitarized Zone  in 2010. Unlike K5, though, South Korea’s guard robot came fully armed."
414,"While Apple has yet to publicly announce a specific launch date for the Apple Watch beyond ""Early 2015"", sources speaking to 9to5Mac say the company is currently planning for a March debut in the initial wave of countries. Sources in the retail segment indicate that select store employees will undergo centralized Apple Watch training the week of February 9, with those employees in turn training others at their individual stores in the days leading up to the device's launch.

One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch. These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.The report indicates Apple has been continuing to refine various aspects of the Apple Watch since its September unveiling, focusing mostly on software but also tweaking such components as the inductive charging mechanism.

Developers are currently working with Apple's WatchKit tools and iOS 8.2 betas to build apps for Apple Watch, starting with lightweight Glances, actionable notifications, and iPhone-based apps that project portions of their interfaces to the watch. More powerful apps running directly on the Apple Watch will be possible later this year.

416,"WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.
“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”
“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”
After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

417,"A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, described them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: “It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

“They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick. “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,” he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: “A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,” the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. “It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,” one wrote.

“May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.”

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

418,"VENICE BEACH, Calif. --You've probably heard Apple is launching its latest i-device, a new Apple Watch, in April and that it will start at $350.

But did you know there are three editions of the watch? What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line ""Watch Edition"" will sell for.

We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.

So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?

Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.

""I'd get the $350 model,"" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. ""I wouldn't go any higher.""

Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. ""Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,"" she said.

Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. ""I like gold watches,"" he says. ""I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'""

Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.

In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.

Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. ""t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,"" notes the site.

But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.

Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.

But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.

With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. ""It would….but you've got to go Gold,"" he said. ""If you've got it, flaunt it.""

In the video, the Islamic State says that Obama’s authorization of strikes against IS places United States “upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” accordin to BNO.

423,"The reported ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, the terrorist group still holding more than 200 girls captive, does not appear to be working out, as violence over the weekend put the possibility of the girls' return on even more tenuous ground.

As Reuters reports, while the Nigeria's Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the deal last Friday, it was not confirmed by Boko Haram. At least five attacks have occurred since the announcement.

From CNN:

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

According to Reuters, negotiations between the government and the insurgency are expected to continue in Chad on Monday, but family members of those kidnapped are skeptical of whether they will be productive.

424,"Apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the Apple Watch to be made available next year, only saying that the price will start at $350 for the entry-level version, likely to be the Apple Watch Sport, which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material.

But jewelry industry experts believe the Apple Watch Edition, which comes with 18-karat yellow gold or rose gold, a sapphire crystal display and Venetian leather for its bands, will cost around $1,200, with other jewelers estimating that Apple's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as $10,000.

Watch expert Chad Rickicki of Pittsburgh, Penn. told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. That does not even include the smartwatch's electronic components and the profit margin Apple plans to tack on to the device. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki.

However, other jewelers are not as optimistic, saying that we need to understand the materials Apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. The term ""18-karat gold,"" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Otherwise, Apple would have used the term ""gold-plated.""

The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is ""twice as hard as standard gold."" Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted.

Adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with, estimating that Apple has to pay around $30 to $40 for the sapphire crystal case of the Edition smart watch. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000.

""The Edition is going to be far, far less mass-produced than the steel version,"" he says. ""I think it's going to have a much different type of distribution. It'll be a much more exclusive product."""
425,"Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday night that U.S. border officials have caught “at least 10″ Islamic State fighters or people with ties to the group as they tried to enter the U.S. through Mexico, a claim that was immediately disputed by the Obama administration.

“I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter said on Fox News Tuesday night. “There’s nobody talking about it.”

When asked by host Greta Van Susteren how he knows this, Hunter said, “Because I’ve asked the Border Patrol, Greta.”

The Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman disputed Hunter’s claim on Wednesday morning.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” said Marsha Catron. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

But Hunter’s office replied by saying Hunter was told directly by a senior official that people with ties to the Islamic State have in fact been apprehended.

“A high level source within the Border Patrol told the congressman otherwise,” said Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper. “The congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told. It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Hunter said Tuesday that the biggest risk that the Islamic State poses to Americans is by trying to enter the U.S. illegally and committing acts of terrorism.

“If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,” he said. “It’s that simple.”

“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,” he added. “The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border, which they already have.”

The Obama administration has come under increased scrutiny about border enforcement in light of fears that Islamic State fighters could try to enter the U.S. through Mexico. Officials were already under fire for its effort to ease immigration rules, which many Republicans say has created even more incentive for people to try entering the country illegally.

Bale is apparently in final talks to take on the role of Jobs, according to film industry publication Variety, which believes the casting is essentially a done deal. Bale will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

The two are working from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who himself won an Oscar in 2011 for penning ""The Social Network."" The film is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography.

There has been some turmoil behind the scenes on the project, as director David Fincher was previously attached, but reportedly walked away after making demands of $10 million in up front payment and full control over marketing. Sony, which is responsible for the film, was apparently reluctant to make that commitment after a marketing debacle with Fincher's adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""

Bale won an Oscar in 2011 for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ""The Fighter."" He was also nominated last year for Best Actor for ""American Hustle,"" but is perhaps best known for playing Batman in Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy."
431,"Tiger Woods isn't golfing. He's taking some time off to rest, to heal, and to work on his game. But according to one dude who probably doesn't know anything, it's all a coverup, and Woods is actually serving a secret Tour suspension for a failed drug test. Today, both the PGA Tour and Woods's agent flatly deny the claim.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question! He played a single full season on Tour in 2004, hasn't played a PGA event since 2011, and now mostly caddies and gives lessons. But he had this to say:

""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this. It's not testosterone, but it's something else. I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""
That's a strong allegation to make, and Olsen had better be able to back it up. (He's not, but more on that in a bit.) Today, the PGA Tour said it's all horseshit.

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.
Woods's agent, too:

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"" agent Mark Steinberg said. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""
Olsen is walking back everything he said, telling ESPN.com his Friday comments were ""only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts."" Which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word ""opinion.""

Olsen went on to say that ""I'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about Tiger,"" and it might have been the first true thing he's said in four days."

Police are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping high street shoppers if they sneeze.

In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man, who wears a tweed jacket, first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday.

The following day, the same man is thought to have slapped an 82-year-old woman who had just sneezed in Scotch Street, Carlisle. Sgt Gill Cherry of Cumbria Police said the pensioner was left feeling 'confused and upset'.

Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses – but have yet to trace the victim.

Cumbrian Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket.

The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them.

Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

'It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.'

Shoppers in Carlisle yesterday said they were concerned by the eccentric's behaviour, although Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, said: 'I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold.

'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back.

'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.'

Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

The shocking incident happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong Province, where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street.

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm. When the nurse raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, the mother had refused to let go and continued to bite the tiny limb.

A hospital spokesman said: ""It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite. Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart. After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""

Police said the woman had been identified as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua. They said enquiries had found that, despite being pregnant, her mother-in-law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly. The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help.

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman's actions and whether the child should be officially confiscated from both her and her husband's family, who no longer seem to want anything to do with her, and also possibly her child."

A graphic video obtained by NBC News purportedly shows James Wright Foley, a freelance reporter for the U.S.-based news service GlobalPost who was kidnapped while reporting from Syria two years ago, reciting threats against America before he is executed by an ISIS militant.

Foley was kidnapped at gunpoint near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He had not been heard from during his time in captivity. ""We’ve heard nothing. Nothing. We last knew that he was abducted on Thanksgiving Day in the Idlib province, but we don’t know who took him or why,"" Foley's father, John, said on TODAY last year.

Foley traveled extensively in the Middle East and North Africa. He reported about conflicts from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, where he was once held captive for 44 days.

In May 2011, Foley recorded a video interview with The Boston Globe about his arrest and captivity in Libya. “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011,” he said. “I believe that front-line journalism is important.”

In the video, ISIS claims they are holding a second journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff. A man on the video is identified as Soltoff and his life is threatened if the United States does not pull out of Iraq.

The woman, who is known only as Lana, describes herself as a feminist who has fought for women’s rights “to the point of eschewing a career”.

She wrote that when she found out she was pregnant in 2012 she was overjoyed until she realised it was a boy.

“I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.

“Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just… sheltering me.”

After three days of mourning about the idea of bringing a “monster” into the world, she decided to go to an abortion clinic and have the foetus removed.

She said: “I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

“If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.”

She wrote that during her experiences of fighting for women’s rights, she found that “men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances”.

“This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it,” she wrote.

Lana’s blog post has since received much criticism, with people calling her a “mentally ill female”, and writing messages such as: “Her mother already brought a monster into the word by giving birth to HER!”

On her blog Lana wrote that she had lost many friends and family members over the last three years, and responded to the criticism she had received.

“I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body?,” she wrote.

“The thing that I hope everyone takes away from all of this is that I own the reasons why I chose to have an abortion. Most of you reading probably have no idea what it is like to go through the process of debating whether or not to abort a pregnancy, let alone the actual experience of it.

“To me, the experience was liberating, the emotions I felt when deciding what I should do, and after learning my foetus was male was something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Coming out of it a liberated woman though was more than worth it.”

Abortion based on gender is already illegal here in the UK, but MPs have been fighting to clarify the amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act that states this.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

A Telegraph investigation found that gender-based abortion does still take place in the UK, with some cultures favouring boys over girls."
450,"TEXAS CITY — A local plumber is being flooded with phone calls — and some threats — after a picture of one of his old company vehicles being used by Islamist militants in Syria was posted on Twitter.
The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer said. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn’t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.
“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said."
451,"Comcast, the cable company widely applauded for its outstanding customer service, has unfairly come under fire for its totally reasonable reaction to a customer's complaint.

According to the Consumerist, a customer identified as ""Conal"" claims he was fired from the accounting firm where he worked after a Comcast rep called his boss and told on him for trying to report his terrible customer service experience to Comcast higher-ups.

The story starts as most Comcast stories start: with the cable company charging Conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used. When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request — stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. — and charged him for it. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake.

So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. No one ever sorted out Conal's customer-service request.

This, Conal claims, is where it gets messy. The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. The call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to Conal's firing.

According to the Consumerist:

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place.

Comcast: still the worst."
454,"It was less than two weeks ago that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin was gushing over Christian Bale as the best actor on the board in a certain age range” and his ideal choice to play Apple founder Steve Jobs in a new biopic. He said he “couldn’t be more excited” to have cast him in the role. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale has dropped out of the project.

Sources told THR that “after much deliberation and conflicting feelings” Bale “came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.” Before Bale was given the chance to turn down the role, it was reportedly offered to Leonardo DiCaprio, who also declined.

Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Seth Rogen is set to play Jobs’ co-founder Steve Wozniak. But without a signed deal with producer Scott Rudin, that casting could definitely change as well.

With Bale and DiCaprio out of the picture, what appropriately-aged, Oscar-calibar actor who looks enough like Steve Jobs could be left? And whatever you do, don’t say Ashton Kutcher.

455,"Questions surrounded purported deal between Nigerian government and Boko Haram for release of missing schoolgirls

The Nigerian government says it has agreed a ceasefire with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram and is negotiating for the release of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped six months ago.

The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa’s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: “We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.”

But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis.

Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: “Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.”

Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”, he said.

The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria’s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap.

The failure of Jonathan’s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls’ plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan’s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down.

In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls’ right to an education.

Jonathan’s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls.

Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country’s president, Idriss Déby. “Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,” said Tukur. “They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” he added.

But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram’s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu.

Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu’s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: “I have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau.”

Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria’s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. “Government wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,” he told a Chatham House event in Abuja.

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group’s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means “western education is forbidden”. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders – the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, which means “People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad”.

Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity. This week about 50 protesters in red shirts tried to march to the presidential villa but were repeatedly diverted by riot police. The president has blamed activists for politicising the abductions and influencing the parents."
456,"Editors' note: There are images in this post that some readers may find distressing.

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

I was w/ James Foley in Aleppo, August 2012 for a day in #Selahaddin. Syrian opposition members were adoring him. He was a kind, brave man

My thoughts are with James Foley’s family. No matter what he faced, he was unfailingly kind, generous, and warm. A wonderful soul.

— Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) August 19, 2014

There was also anger on Twitter that YouTube didn't immediately take down the video.

It's lucky that video didn't have a unlicensed Katy Perry song as a soundtrack or it would've been deleted from YouTube in seconds.

— Tom Gara (@tomgara) August 19, 2014

However, within an hour of the first report of the beheading, the video was taken down.

Images from the video are below, showing Foley before his execution and Sotloff being threatened:

Shortly after the clip appeared on the web, journalists and observers who watch the region began tweeting a hashtag — #ISISmediaBlackout — pledging to stop sharing Islamic State propaganda.

""You know what I think? And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

Post by Free James Foley.

Foley's parents appeared on the Today show last year, pleading for his release.

UPDATED 8:28 p.m. ET: GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni released a statement Tuesday about the video that purportedly shows the beheading of journalist James Foley.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

Foley reported in Syria for GlobalPost as a freelancer.

458,"British actor poised to take the lead in Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, after Leonardo DiCaprio pulled out

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.

Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles. There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”"

“The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas ‘patient zero.’ Frisco firefighter-paramedics are in the process of transporting the patient,” a statement from Dana Baird-Hanks, a spokeswoman with the city of Frisco, said.

Paramedics are reportedly transporting the patient, who has not yet been identified, to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the Morning News reported. Staff and patrons of the facility are being examined for the deadly virus.

Since Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, there have been 5,000 false alarms in the U.S., Forbes wrote Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Controls said it received more than 800 calls a day regarding the deadly disease -- a drastic jump from the 50 calls a day it received before Duncan’s infection was known.

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. “It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,” said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. “He fought courageously in this battle.”

More than 3,400 people in West Africa have been killed by the latest outbreak. The virus might have been spread through handling “bushmeat,” which is the meat of African wild animals, and contact with infected bats.

461,"Fourteen more police arrested as forensic investigators find no trace of students missing since violent confrontation in Guerrero

Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico say they are yet to find any trace of 43 students who disappeared after a confrontation with police.

None was among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the 26 September attack, said the attorney general, Jesús Murillo Karam.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of a 10th mass grave on Tuesday. An additional 14 police officers had been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighbouring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in taking the students. The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Karam said officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack but the collusion might have gone beyond just one town. “There’s a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it’s clear to me that they were working together,” he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 teaching college students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, despite investigators combing the clandestine burial sites outside Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, the Guerrero governor, Angel Aguirre, said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

“Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,” Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification was an arduous, time-consuming process. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves could leave very little DNA for testing.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched peacefully to the centre of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organisers handed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1m peso (£47,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles south of Mexico City, and set fire to buildings."
462,"Throughout the three-plus years of the Syrian civil war, one oft-sung refrain among some American officials has been that arming Syrian moderates (whoever they may be) is a dicey proposition because the weapons ""could fall into the wrong hands.""

Despite these objections, the United States eventually sent military aid to the Free Syrian Army last year. The policy change was precipitated by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's violation of the Obama administration's ""red line"" after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.

Last month, with the rise of ISIS in mind, Congress approved the president's plan to to train and arm the Syrian rebels. There was some familiar dissent at the time. ""How will we ensure that the United States weapons we are providing to Syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands, as they did with the rebels we supported in Libya?"" Representative Barbara Lee asked.

On the same day as that vote, Islamic State fighters first encircled Kobani, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, attacking the largely Kurdish town and inspiring vigorous American airstrikes. On Monday, hoping to decisively turn the tide in the battle, the United States airdropped weapons to the Syrian Kurds of Kobani. By way of explanation, especially to a skeptical Turkish audience, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered that not aiding the Kurds in their fight against ISIS is both ""irresponsible"" and ""morally very difficult.""

Unfortunately, with that one airdrop, the weight of the American dread about where its weapons might go also landed. According to the Associated Press, some of the weapons meant to reach the Kurds ended up in Islamic State hands instead.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State.
The Associated Press said the video was consistent with other reporting. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, British activist group, added that more than one cache of weapons might have been snatched up by Islamic State fighters.

Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that Islamic State fighters have captured American weapons. This might just have been the easiest."

The experimental store will work as a mini-warehouse for some same day deliveries in New York. It'll surely serve as a nice little billboard, too.

The new brick-and-mortar shop is actually across the street from the Empire State Building, so it's clearly primo real estate. That's surely why analysts think that Amazon is opening the space as a marketing effort. It doesn't hurt that the company will be able to show off its (now sizable) lineup of products, including Kindles of all kinds and the new Fire phone. The store will also handle pick-ups and returns.

This is not the first time that Amazons's toyed with the idea of a physical presence, however.

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Scroll down for video

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now — are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'

The excavation came just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and, when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period."
468,"The state of North Dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after President Barack Obama.

In an overwhelming 35-10 vote, the state Senate advanced a bill naming a 650-acre site currently under construction after the nation’s 44th president. Governor Jack Dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law Tuesday.

When completed, the Barack Obama Memorial Landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in North Dakota, and the 17th largest in the United States. It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries.

“We wanted to do something to honor the president,” says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. “And I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama’s presidency.

“We originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.”

The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage.

“I supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;” says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. “But he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home.

“I guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I’m a Democrat. But honestly I don’t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.”

470,"Though Apple was mum about battery life for its forthcoming wrist-worn accessory when it was announced on Tuesday, the company has since said that it expects people to charge it nightly, suggesting the battery life will offer about one day of operation.

""There's a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,"" Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris said in a statement to Re/code. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly, which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.""

But sources who spoke with John Paczkowski went further, and indicated that the company isn't happy with the current uptime of the Apple Watch. One person said the watch's battery life is currently ""about a day,"" and that the company is working on modifications ahead of its launch to improve it.

A one-day battery life is about on par with other touchscreen smart watches currently available on the market, including devices running the competing Android Wear platform.

The uptime stands in contrast to less powerful smart watches, like the Pebble, which utilizes a monochrome black-and-white display and lacks a touchscreen. Pebble's low-power screen is always on and provides up to a week of use before the wrist-borne device needs to be recharged.

Battery life for the Apple Watch remains somewhat up in the air because the product isn't yet finalized and ready for launch. Apple revealed on Tuesday that the wearable device will launch at some time in early 2015, but declined to offer a more specific window.

The company was also vague on other aspects of the hardware, including pricing. While the Apple Watch will start at $349, a breakdown of how much various models will cost was not given.

While the Apple Watch will start at $349, it's possible that the high-end models could reach into a five-figure price point. The luxury Apple Watch Edition is made of hardened 18-karat gold, and existing 18-karat gold watches typically sell for more than $10,000."
472,"American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said.

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as ""The Beatles.""

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain's two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified."
474,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured.

Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page.

The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible.

Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting.

Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.

Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet. A link will be added in the comments if the story is officially confirmed or denied.

475,"When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don’t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that’s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.

IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH…

Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal’s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.

He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.

A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal’s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.

Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.

CUTTING THE CORD

He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.

But things didn’t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn’t order.

“There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,” he says.

Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he’d never requested and had no use for.

When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation’s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.

He says even this didn’t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn’t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal’s account into collections in Feb. 2014.

THE CALL IN QUESTION

And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast’s customer service, which hadn’t been of any help in the year he’d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company’s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as “bizarre,” with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with “How can I help you?” Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn’t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller’s office again, to let them know that the rep they’d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.

But something did happen. Just not anything good.

WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK

Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it’s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.

And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast’s books. So Conal doesn’t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.

In response to a letter from Conal’s lawyer — he has not filed a lawsuit, but it’s not out of the question — Comcast’s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal’s employer but says that Conal “is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn” about his dispute with Comcast.

THE HEART OF THE MATTER

I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office.

Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.

And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.

I’m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.

How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like “I’m a lawyer” or “I’m a big shot at [fill in the blank]“? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer’s employer?

We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it’s company policy to contact customers’ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.

“Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,” reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds “we will review his lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”"
476,"NOTHING tops off a holiday in Bali like discovering there is a spider burrowing under your skin.

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas’ first trip to Bali last weekend was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.

21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval and heading upwards.

“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors early on Sunday morning, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

Later that morning he awoke to blisters.

“That’s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist on Monday, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan’s recent appendix removal.

“It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,” he said.

He has now earnt himself the nickname Spider-man.

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days."

478,"Apple has ""studied platinum watch casings"" according to a new report in The Wall Street Journal. However, it’s not expected to announce the new case during today’s ""Spring Forward"" event. The WSJ also corroborates rumors that Apple will be redesigning its stores to include a space where customers can try on the watch by appointment.

It’s likely that Apple will be limiting the initial buying experience to its own stores, where the company has total control over the sales experience. Reuters reports that Apple resellers, like Best Buy, may not carry the watch at launch, with Macy’s, Saks, Bloomingdale's, and Barney’s expressing the same. Apple held a private event at the luxury retailer Colette in Paris back in September, hinting at a possible store-within-a-store retail strategy for Apple Watch Edition sales. Reuters notes that Nordstrom has been in discussions with Apple.

The Apple Watch will go on sale in April with 38mm and 42mm cases made from aluminum, stainless steel, and a scratch resistant 18-karat gold. Platinum is the obvious omission, a material commonly used by luxury watch makers such as Rolex and Omega.

Apple Watch strap materials include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel. While a gold strap hasn’t been announced yet, some, including Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, have speculated that it could be announced today and push the Watch Edition price to the $20,000 mark. The Watch Sport model features hardened Ion-X glass and a composite (plastic) back, while both the stainless steel Watch and gold Watch Edition models use sapphire crystal and ceramic backs.

The video starts with a clip of President Barack Obama earlier this month making the announcement that he had authorized targeted strikes in Iraq to protect American interests in Irbil. It then cuts to a title scene that says ""Message to America"" before cutting to a desert scene, with Foley in orange clothes on his knees, and a man in all black standing next to him. 

In the video Foley delivers a statement calling on his friends and family to ""rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.""

Then the ISIS member makes a statement. Speaking in what may possibly be a British accent, he identifies Foley and says his death is a direct result of American intervention in Iraq. 

""So any attempt by you Obama, to deny the Muslims of living in safety under Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

He then beheads Foley.

Freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff is then shown also in an orange jumpsuit on his knees. The man in black then says ""The life of this American citizen Obama, depends on your next decision.""

About 20 minutes after posting the video was removed from YouTube.

According to BuzzFeed, two people who know Foley confirmed that the man in the video looks and sounds like him.

In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said that if the video is genuine they are ""appalled by the brutal murder."" 

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire and was originally a teacher, at one point teaching prison inmates in Arizona, before attending the Medill school of journalism at Northwestern University. After graduation, his first assignment was as an embed with the U.S. Army’s 173rd Brigade and 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan.  Foley had been covering the Syria's civil war for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse (AFP) when he was allegedly pulled from the car he was traveling in to meet with a colleague and abducted at gunpoint. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, GlobalPost hired an international security firm for a ground level investigation in Northern Syria and along the Turkish border to locate him.

Foley was also detained and held for 44 days in Libya in 2011.

A graphic sex video that has been shared across South America after rumours emerged that it involved a female teacher and her teenage pupil has been exposed as a fake.

The footage was shared by thousands of people in Argentina after false reports came out that it showed a woman called Lucita Sandoval from the city of Santiago del Estero with a 16-year-old boy.

Internet gossip sites incorrectly stated that Miss Sandoval was a teacher and was secretly filmed by a grinning pupil of hers.

It has since emerged that the woman in the video is not Miss Sandoval, but a completely different woman from the city of Corrientes in Argentina.

And reports that she engaged in sexual antics with a school pupil proved to be false too, after it was revealed the young man in the video is a college student.

It was also falsely reported that the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils

An Argentinian newspaper investigated the claims, and found that no such woman exists and the video appears to be a private sex tape that was shared via Whatsapp and then uploaded to a hardcore porn website."

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

484,"OTTAWA - The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" tweeted New Democrat Craig Scott.

487,"With Apple's media event just a week away and the company expected to offer final details there on the Apple Watch ahead of its April debut, The New York Times has a new report out sharing a few new tidbits on the device.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

488,"The marine was shot during a mission in the dangerous Helmand Province last year

Dramatic footage has emerged of a US marine being shot in the head by a Taliban sniper, only to be saved by his Kevlar helmet.

The video was captured on the helmet camera of a marine in 2013, when he and two other marines were taking part in a reconnaissance mission in the NawZad district of the renowned Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

The video begins with the team searching a compound; however, when they hear gunfire they decide to investigate where it is coming from.

After walking through a tunnel the team fall quiet, before the silence is broken by the sound of a sniper’s bullet ricocheting off one of the marine’s Kevlar helmets.

The team quickly fall back to safety using the radio to explain what has just happened.

When in a safe area, the bewildered marine asks, “What just happened?”

“Dude, you got shut” the marine with the camera tells him, “I saw it hit your Kevlar.”

The marine then complains that his ears are ringing, before inspecting the damage that the bullet caused to his helmet.

Tokyo: Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumours ranging from a stroke to a coup d'etat, is apparently just recovering from ankle surgery.

Mr Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the source said, adding that the leader had had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world's most impenetrable country, that rumours spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Mr Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Mr Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. The rumours went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the ""Great Successor"" was in an ""indisposed condition"".

""Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,"" said the narrator of a documentary called Improving the Lives of the People, showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month.

Outside commentators have guessed that Mr Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China's official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: ""For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the militant group has Russian-made MiG 21 and 23 warplanes.

The Observatory said the militants are being trained at the al Jarrah airbase on the eastern side of Aleppo.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the SOHR, said officers from the Iraqi army who had defected to Islamic State (IS) had ""overseen the training of some militants in order to be able to lead these aircraft"".

He said local activist had contacted his organisation having spotted the planes flying low over the area. ""It is worth mentioning that it is not the first time that the people witness an aircraft flying at a low altitude after taking off from al Jarrah airbase,"" Rahman said, adding that the jets were purportedly stolen by militants who had occupied airports and airbases affiliated to the Syrian government.

The SOHR said it could not confirm if the Islamic State had any access to missiles.

""We're not aware of (Islamic State) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" US Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

US Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder told Reuters that the US was ""not aware of [Islamic State] conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere.""

""We continue to keep a close eye on their activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

Separately, UK authorities have charged four men with terror offences, including taking an oath of allegiance to IS.

The Metropolitan Police force said the men, Tarik Hassane, Suhaib Majeed, Nyall Hamlett and Momen Motasim, who were arrested in London over the past two weeks, were charged with preparing acts of terrorism between July and October, including procuring a Baikal handgun and ammunition and using Google Street View to conduct reconnaissance on a police station and an army barracks in west London."

498,"Twitter users are suggesting the phallic daubing could have been the handiwork of a jilted lover or jealous rival

The owner of a £1.5 million Bugatti Veyron supercar could be left with a £500,000 dent in their pocket after crude vandals painted a huge penis on its bonnet.

Yobs targeted the silver-coloured car which was parked in a street in Seattle, US.

The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport is the world’s most expensive production car and is capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.6 seconds.

But its flashy owner will be reeling, as the graffiti is set to slash a whopping half a million pounds off the racing car's retail value.

The image was posted on Reddit this week, with some users condemning the graffiti artists for vandalism and other suggesting it was the handiwork of a jilted lover.

One Twitter user even suggested it could be a sign of activism by the culprit.

499,"A newly released audio recording aired by CNN Monday purportedly captures the sound of gunfire from the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

The unauthenticated audio was recorded by a man who says he was taping a video chat conversation when the shooting of the unarmed black teen by a white police officer occurred around noon on Saturday, Aug. 9.

CNN said it could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio. The man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, said that her client discussed the tape with the FBI. The FBI has yet to comment on whether it questioned the man who made the recording.

""He heard loud noises and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,"" Blumenthal told CNN's Don Lemon. ""It just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.""

On the audio, a man can be heard video-chatting a friend while shots ring out in the background. After a pause in the gunfire, more shots can be heard.

A forensic audio expert told the network that he detected a cluster of six gunshots followed by four more after the pause on the recording. A private autopsy ordered by Brown's family found last week that the unarmed teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head."
500,"Iraqi Member of Parliament Ali al-Bredi has claimed that Islamic State (IS) militants are using Chlorine gas against Iraqi soldiers in Fallujah.

In a press conference on Monday, al-Bredi revealed that IS have killed 300 Iraqi soldiers with chlorine gas.

He said that the militants deployed the gas in the Siqiliya area located of northern Fallujah, a city in Anbar province, about 70 km from the capital of Iraq, Baghdad.

“Responsibility for this lies with Iraqi PM Haidar Abadi and the commander of the forces in Anbar as they failed to rescue the  soldiers,” said al-Bredi.

Expanding on the circumstances surrounding the attack, al-Bredi said, “After the insurgents surrounded the Iraqi soldiers, they used chlorine gas to suffocate them before detonating a car bomb, resulting in the death of 300 out of 400 soldiers.”

Al-Bredi also said that before the crime was committed, the soldiers asked for an urgent rescue mission, but were ignored.

Furthermore, on Sunday, US Secretary of State John Kerry also reiterated US concern over the use of chlorine gas against civilians in Syria and warned President Bashar al-Assad’s regime that it would be held to account."
502,"Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.

The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Scroll down for videos

Job done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamber

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.

Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa

Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.

Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.

Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.

A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.

One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking.

The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.

Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'"

A man blamed his small penis for his girlfriend breaking up with him and decided to chop it off with a razor.

But after cutting off his organ and throwing it in a bin, 22-year-old Oliver Ilic, was unable to stop the bleeding.

He called emergency services and was taken to a hospital in Kocani, Macedonia, where he told medics he had decided to cut it off because it was no use.

He explained his girlfriend had ended their relationship after telling him he was not good in bed.

Oliver Ilic, 22, from Macedonia, called for help after he was unable to stop the bleeding after he cut off his penis

Police searched his house and found the severed penis in a bin along with the razor blade he had used.

Local doctors were unable to reattach the organ and Mr Ilac was taken to another hospital in capital Skopje - where surgeons successfully reattached it in a five-hour operation.

But it is too early to know if Mr Ilac's penis will function properly again.

Another Macedonian man recently chopped off his own penis.

But unlike Mr Ilic, the man flushed it away in the toilet so it was not able to be reattached.

504,"A MAN who was dumped by his girlfriend when she told him he was not any good in bed chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin.

The man told medics he felt his small penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless, decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he couldn’t stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also in the bin.

Although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they didn’t have the competence to reattach the member. Instead Ilic was transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje where surgeons managed to reattach it in a complicated five-hour operation.

It’s still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it worked, whether the man’s organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off his penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago, but in his case the penis was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away."
505,"Omar Gonzalez, the White House fence-jumper from earlier this month, apparently surprised the guard at the front door because a nearby alarm box had been muted:

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

So....they just lied?

On a related note, I wonder who the whistleblowers are that have been feeding all this stuff to WaPo's Carol Leonnig? Not that it matters, I suppose, but I'm curious about whether it's folks who are appalled by the security lapses or folks who have some other kind of axe to grind."

This rather bold -- and entirely fake -- claim by the website was further entrenched into people's minds by the fact that it listed Charles Bolden, NASA administrator as the source of the claim.

Huzlers.com claimed that the cause of the blackout was, 'due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.'

The story went viral with panicked and concerned citizens immediately turning to Twitter to voice their concerns over the worldwide blackout.

508,"Last month, Islamist radicals seized Tripoli International Airport and took possession of as many as 11 commercial jetliners, according to a report from Magharebia, an online news site covering North Africa. 
News of the stolen planes have now created concerns for officials, who fear the militants may use them to carry out acts of terrorism against America.
“Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries, but for all countries of the world,” said a Moroccan reporter shortly after news broke of the stolen jetliners.
According to veteran reporter Bill Gertz, U.S. officials said that they received intelligence indicating eleven commercial aircraft could be used to attack New York City or Washington, D.C. on the anniversary of the September, 11, 2001 jihadi attacks on America.
“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” said one unidentified government official.
Tripoli Airport is currently occupied by two rival groups deemed “terrorists” by the Libyan parliament: Misrata and Zintan, who had previously worked together to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi.
On Monday, Libyan officials announced that their capital city in Tripoli had been completely lost to Islamist forces. Libyan PM Abdullah al-Thani, who recently stepped down from his role, said: “Ministry and state offices in Tripoli have been occupied by armed militias who are preventing government workers from entering and are threatening their superiors,” explaining that he was “trying to ensure the continuity of services from afar.”

509,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese authorities detained a woman and young boy believed to be the wife and son of the reclusive Islamic State group leader, and were questioning the woman and conducting DNA tests on the child, senior Lebanese officials said Tuesday.

If their identities are confirmed, Lebanon may use the pair as bargaining chips to win the release of soldiers and police taken hostage by the extremists in cross-border attacks earlier this year.

The woman, who was identified as an Iraqi, and the child were taken into custody about 10 days ago while carrying fake ID cards, the officials said.

Very little is known about Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's personal life, including how many wives and children he has. Conservative interpretations of Islam allow men to marry up to four wives. The Islamic State group did not immediately comment on the detentions, but the faction's supporters on Twitter and militant websites cast doubt on the reports.

Adding to the confusion, the Lebanese army did not release an official statement regarding the pair.

A Lebanese military official identified the woman as Saja al-Dulaimi who was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida-linked branch, earlier this year. The official said the woman ""confessed during interrogation"" that she was al-Baghdadi's wife.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

In March, the Nusra Front freed more than a dozen Greek Orthodox nuns in exchange for the release of dozens of female prisoners by the Syrian government. A woman named Saja al-Dulaimi was reportedly on the list of prisoners freed by Damascus.

A judicial official said the interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor, Saqr Saqr, and that a DNA test was underway to confirm that the child is her son. Experts said it would be difficult to confirm whether the woman is indeed al-Baghdadi's wife.

It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small — although growing — support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.

The detentions added to the mystery that continues to surround al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. He has only made one known public appearance — a sermon he delivered in July at a mosque in Mosul just days after IS declared him the head of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territory the group controls in Syria and Iraq.

Last month, Iraqi officials claimed he was wounded in an airstrike. The U.S. has not confirmed those reports, and al-Baghdadi released a new audiotape days after he was purportedly hit.

The Lebanese daily As-Safir first reported the detention of the Islamic State leader's alleged relatives, saying the woman and boy were taken into custody near a border crossing point with Syria. It said the arrest came in ""coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.""

If the pair's identities are confirmed, the detentions could give Lebanese authorities leverage in their attempts to reach a prisoner-exchange deal with militants from the Islamic State group and the Nusra Front. The extremists have been holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hostage since August, and have demanded the release of Islamist prisoners held by Lebanon. On Monday night, the Nusra Front threatened to kill one of the soldiers it holds captive.

Lebanese troops have clashed repeatedly with militants along the border with Syria since August.

On Tuesday, militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the frontier, killing six soldiers and wounding one, Lebanon's military said. The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon and was followed by clashes, the army said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but there was no immediate indication that it was connected to the detention of al-Baghdadi's alleged family members.

Meanwhile, supporters of the Islamic State group released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video, posted online Monday by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man inside, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video's authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving Nov. 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by Islamic State supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of Islamic State group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters Tuesday that ""the Dane is doing better.""

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

The shop will likely be located near the entrance of the iconic Wonder Room, a 19,000-square-foot shopping hall that houses a wide selection of luxury jewelry and watch brands alongside a concept store and mezzanine wine bar.

Wonder Room at Selfridges in London houses fine jewelry and watches
A section of Selfridges located near the Wonder Room was boarded up earlier this month to allow for construction of the expected Apple Watch pop-up shop, sources say. The store-within-a-store concept will display various Apple Watch models and provide customers with a personalized shopping experience, potentially including One to One service for those interested in learning more about the wrist-worn device.

Apple is recruiting retail employees from nearby Apple Stores in London to fill Specialist vacancies at an upcoming Central London location, which is likely to be this Selfridges boutique. The pop-up shop is expected to be readied in time for the Apple Watch launch in April and will likely join Galeries Lafayette as one of multiple standalone Apple Watch stores that Apple plans to open throughout Europe.

Selfridges has the second-largest retail space in the United Kingdom behind competing high-end department store Harrods. The store offers a myriad of designer jewelry and accessories, such as watches, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pendants and rings. With the Apple Watch positioned at least partially as a fashion item, the department store offers an ideal setting for the wrist-worn device to be displayed.

511,"The leaked video of Georgy Myakinkin's protest against heavy-handed security guards at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia, has gone viral

This is the moment an airport worker protested against 'rough' security guards - by stripping NAKED and walking through the scanner in just his socks.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, left his keys at work following his shift at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia.

When he returned to collect them, he says ""heavy-handed"" security guards stopped him 'unnecessarily' and told him he had to remove his belt.

Staging an impromptu protest, he then stripped naked - apart from his socks - before sauntering through the scanner, leaving the guards gobsmacked.

CEN   Bare cheek: Down come the trousers

He said: ""I returned to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner.

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict - security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""

CEN   Strip-gate: But he left socks on before passing through

Georgy whipped off his clothes and walked through the scanner. The speechless officers then allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day, he discovered that the CCTV security camera video had been leaked and gone viral.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

CEN   Viral: He retrieves watch in video which was leaked

A spokesman said: ""We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.""

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video.

He said: ""I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh.""

An article appeared on ikwiz claims that the film-maker has approached Disney for an early release of the movie, which is currently scheduled to hit the theatres on 18 December.
As per the report, Abrams made the announcement at the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards that was held on 4 February.
The website also stated that Disney has taken the request seriously and is looking for a possible release date for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in summer.
If the reports are true then the seventh instalment of ""Star Wars"" film series will be released in June along with ""Jurassic World"" and there will be a box office clash between the three most anticipated movies of the year.
The main reason for an early release of the film is said to be the alleged leaks of plots and images from the sets and scripts and Abrams believes that it will make the movie predictable and not worthy of watching, according to Movie Pilot.?
 

However, the makers of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" have not released any official statement on the early release date of the movie."

The performer, real name Henry Jackson, died from kidney complications due to cancer, according to reports.

Jackson formed the Sugarhill Gang with Master Gee and Wonder Mic, having a big hit in 1979 with Rapper's Delight.

The record sold several million copies worldwide and helped establish rap as the genre it is today.

The full version of Rapper's Delight ran nearly 16 minutes long and was recorded in a single take.

The song - famous for its ""hip, hip, a hop"" refrain - featured 'Big Bank' introducing himself as ""six foot one and tons of fun"".

The trio continued to perform together and spent three weeks in the UK singles chart in 1982 with The Lover In You.

Jackson's death was reported by website TMZ and confirmed to Fox News by David Mallie, who manages the two remaining band members.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, February 2015]

Kanye West banned from attending future grammy awards. Is this real?

Origins: On 9 February 2015, the entertainment website Adobo Chronicles published an article claiming that rapper Kanye West had been barred from all future award shows:

He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the 'West boycott.'

While it is true that West created a stir at the 2015 Grammy Awards when he briefly interrupted Beck during the musician's acceptance speech (just as he had done to Taylor Swift in 2009), Kanye has not been banned from all future award shows.

The App Store's 'Top Apps' lists are well known to the smartphone-savvy public, but how apps make it into those lists is perhaps less understood. Today, one micro-blog shared photos under the heading ""It's Hard Being a Top App Worker,"" publicly exposing the operations behind App Store rank-boosting (Ed: which I henceforth dub 'crank-boosting') labour. 

The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. 

Apple has previously adopted measures to deter crank-boosting in order to ensure fair rankings for developers and users. In 2014 November, Apple introduced a 1 yuan strategy to drop the threshold for users to download apps, also intended to negatively impact the crank-boosting industry. 

But as crank-boosting simulates genuine user activity, it is nearly impossible to detect or safeguard against. 

Users accustomed to comparing and contrasting apps before download may be unknowingly swayed by crank-boosted apps that have purchased their celebrity. Such sneaky, industrious operations are tricky to break."

CBI files case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh over forced castration IANS
The agency filed case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief on Wednesday on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Hansraj Chauhan, a former Dera follower, had filed a petition in the high court in 2012 alleging that he along with around 400 male devotees of the Dera were castrated inside the ashram on the orders of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
Disposing off the petition, the high court had ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case in December 2014. The court asked the CBI to file the first status report by 2 March.
Chauhan had demanded a CBI inquiry and compensation for the castration inside the ashram in 2000. Chauhan claimed that the castration of Dera followers was done by the chief through doctors employed in his hospital.
Chauhan said in his petition that he along with other devotees was castrated under false claims that they would be able to realise god through the Dera chief after their castration.
Haryana Police handed over the documents related to the incident to the CBI on 2 January. Haryana Police also provided documents related to seven other devotees of the Dera chief who also claimed to be castrated.
 

The Dera has dismissed the castration allegation. Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is making his film debut with ""MSG: The Messenger of God"", is also facing trial in connection with cases of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples."
520,"The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has agreed to a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped school girls, according to Nigerian officials. The girls were abducted six months ago from a school in Chibok.

Nigerian government officials claimed on Friday to have struck a two-part deal with Boko Haram, including a ceasefire and the release of 219 school girls, whose abduction last April sparked international outrage.
""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. ""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued
The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.
Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is sacrilege,"" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control.
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

521,"Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

Twenty-two-year-old Oliver Ilic cut off his organ with a single swipe from a razor blade and then threw the remains in the bin, the metro.co.uk reports.

He allegedly told doctors that he had a small penis and so his girlfriend dumped him.

Ilic contacted the emergency services when he could not stop the bleeding.

He was taken to hospital in the east Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ and the razor blade in a bin.

After doctors couldn't re-attach his penis in Kochani he was transferred to capital Skopje where it was re-attached with his body following five hours of surgery.

The doctors, however, said that it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if the organ would ever function properly again."

The image is an altered image of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” condom line, which just begs me to ask one question: Can your genitals taste flavors?

Oh, wait… That’s not what they were getting at, is it?

There have been no official corporate announcements determining if this will be a reality or not. But, after seeing this image spread, why wouldn’t Durex look into this?

If there’s anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the PSL trend, right?

524,"Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

526,"Boston| 
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

527,"A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns."

530,"A homeless man was given a hundred dollars, and what he did will make you cry. YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

531,"Nigeria's official news agency says the government fighters from Boko Haram have agreed to an immediate ceasefire.

It quoted the chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, as ordering his troops to immediately comply with the agreement on Friday.

The news came as another official confirmed there had been direct negotiations this week in neighbouring Chad about the release of more than 200 schoolgirls abducted six months ago. 

Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Lagos, said details of the deal have yet to emerge.

""Both sides have agreed there will be no more attacks, no more bombs and no more attacks on Boko Haram.The government will not attack any Boko Haram strongholds for the moment."" Mutasa said.

""We do know Boko Haram wanted certain conditions met, for example they wanted their senior commanders released from government captivity."" Mutasa added.

Abducted schoolgirls

Sources told Al Jazeera that substantial progress had been reached in negotiations about the abducted girls but that no definite deal had been agreed.


Inside Story - Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram?
A senior adviser to Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told Al Jazeera that the deal reached on Friday included the release of the girls, but that no date had been set and that the release was part of an ""ongoing process"".

Doyin Okupe said the government had agreed to ""some concessions"" but did not give any details.

Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained fighters in exchange for the girls.

The group attracted international condemnation with the April abduction of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.

Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.

Jonathan is expected to announce he will run for a second term in office on Saturday.

Vickers served with the RCMP for 29 years before assuming the role at Parliament eight years ago. The sergeant-at-arms is in charge of security at the House of Commons.

Despite his lengthy service, family members have revealed that Wednesday's attack was the first time Vickers had ever shot anyone.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' his brother John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers' family gathered at homes in their hometown of Miramichi, New Brunswick to talk about previous shows of leadership.

The National Post explained how Vickers had been dispatched to the Burnt Church wharf 14 years ago when native and non-native fisherman were scrapping. He often visited when he was off-duty ready to listen to the fishermen and helping to resolve their arguments.

'The inspector was a real community man,' Bobby Sylliboy, a longtime band constable with the Burnt Church First Nation, said. 'He was a professional. And for him to use force, it would have had to have been life or death.'

Relatives added that Vickers' constable son, Andrew, is also a selfless leader after he saved a drowning woman three years ago.

After Wednesday's fraught events, MPs hailed Kevin Vickers a hero.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.

We don't wish to be part of any media circus, we don't think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott on Wednesday.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

He was called into action after Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ran towards the National War Memorial just before 10am on Wednesday and shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a single dad, in the abdomen.

He then ran towards the Parliament and opened fire, shooting dozens of shots as politicians and journalists barricaded doors inside.

Video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons shows a rush of armed police running toward an unseen suspect.

At the head of the pack is a man - Vickers - moving swiftly with his gun toward Zehaf-Bibeau. Vickers takes aim and fires off multiple shots, killing the gunman.

As shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

It has since emerged that the gunman - whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau - had recently converted to Islam and had a length history of petty crime.

He had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized, according to reports.

On Thursday, his mother Susan Bibeau, who sits on the country's Immigration board, released a statement saying she had been shocked by the shooting spree and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime.

She said she felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of her son.

'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, he was lost.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Harper and other MPs stopped to lay a wreath at the war memorial - but as the prime minister arrived, police wrestled a man to the ground for getting too close to the leader, CTV reported.

Security remains tight around the Parliament, as politicians and their staff returned to work on Thursday. The grounds, nearby streets and war memorial are still closed to visitors.

534,"(ANSA) - Ancona, January 23 - A Bolivian nun gave birth in San Severino Marche after being taken to hospital where she complained of a bad stomach ache, Italian newspaper Corriere Adriatico said on Friday.
    The newspaper said the nun, whose age wasn't given, gave birth last Sunday and intends to keep the baby, whose sex wasn't given.
    The nun had been staying at a cloistered convent in the province of Macerata since June.
    The hospital hasn't confirmed the birth and the bishop of nearby town Camerino, Francesco Brugnaro, hasn't made any comment on the case. Another case of a nun giving birth took place in 2011 in Marche, when a 41-year-old Congolese nun gave birth to a baby girl in Pesaro.
    In that case, the nun had been raped abroad by a foreign priest and initially gave her daughter up for adoption.
    The case engendered strong protests from the adoptive family after it reached Italy's highest court of appeals in February 2014 after the nun changed her mind and was granted custody, reversing a lower court decision."

537,"Iguala de la Independencia (Mexico) (AFP) - More bodies were being pulled out of a mass grave in southern Mexico Sunday as authorities worked to determine if 43 students who vanished after a police shooting were among the dead.

At least 15 bodies have so far been dug out of pits discovered Saturday on a hill outside the town of Iguala, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mexico City, two police officers at the scene told AFP.

The grim find came a week after the students disappeared when a protest turned deadly. Witnesses in Iguala say municipal police officers whisked several of the students away.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, declined to say how many bodies were buried in the pits.

""We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site,"" Blanco told a news conference late Saturday in the state capital, Chilpancingo.

The site was was cordoned off and guarded by scores of troops and police.

More bodies were being recovered on Sunday, another officer said.

Juan Lopez Villanueva, an official from the National Human Rights Commission, said that six pits were found up a steep hill probably inaccessible by car.

Four forensic services vans left for the morgue late Saturday carrying nine bodies in silver bags. Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to identify the victims.

The graves were found after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location, Blanco said. The detainees include 22 police officers and gang members.

If the bodies are confirmed to be those of the students, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date.

- Police linked to gang -

The students from a teacher training college disappeared last weekend after Iguala police officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return home after holding fundraising activities on September 26. Three students were killed.

Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

A survivor said in an interview that the officers took away 30 to 40 students in patrol cars.

Blanco said investigators had confirmed suspicions that a criminal organization, the Guerreros Unidos, was involved in last week's crimes and that local police officers belong to the gang.

Authorities have issue an arrest warrant for Iguala's mayor, who has fled.

In Pueblo Viejo, a hamlet surrounded by forests and mountains, a resident said the region is dominated by a drug gang and that he had seen municipal police officers going up the hill in recent days.

""They were going up there back and forth,"" said the resident, Jose Garcia, pointing to a location between two mountains where the graves were found.

- 'Savagely massacred' -

Governor Angel Aguirre appealed for calm in his state, which is mired in poverty, gang violence and social unrest.

""I call on all (Guerrero state residents) to maintain harmony, non-confrontation, and avoid violence,"" he said, offering his support to the families of those who were ""savagely massacred.""

The missing students are from a teacher training college near Chilpancingo known as a hotbed of protests.

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing.

The police's links to organized crime has raised fears about the fate of the students in a country where drug cartels regularly hide bodies in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

The United Nations has called the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times."""
538,"On Tuesday, news spread about the reported arrest and interrogation of the wife and son of Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Lebanon.

Details about the development are still coming into focus. The AP and others reported that the two of them ""were carrying fake identification cards"" when they were picked up near the Syrian border about 10 days ago. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir noted that the operation was conducted with the involvement of “foreign intelligence.” As Reuters reported, Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, ""two Iraqis and one Syrian.""

By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.
According to a security source quoted in AFP, ""the wife and child were taken to the defense ministry headquarters in Yarze, just outside the capital Beirut, 'where investigations were continuing.'"" The source added that the arrests had been kept under wraps so that security arrangements could be made.

It's unclear how useful these arrests will ultimately be, but they come as Lebanese authorities attempt to secure the release of 20 soldiers who are currently being held captive by Islamist groups. By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.

This is already proving to be a bad week for ISIS. While the United States and Turkey had been rumored to be close to a deal to coordinate efforts against the Islamic State, on Tuesday, the Iraqi government reached a once-elusive agreement with the Kurds on both oil sharing and military cooperation in the campaign to fight ISIS.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who took over for the divisive Nuri al-Maliki, is receiving plaudits for his role in bringing the Kurds back into the fold and at least temporarily staving off a Kurdish push for independence."

541,"A South Korean newspaper has reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un underwent surgery to repair fractures in both ankles earlier this month.

The Chosun Ilbo report cited a source who had recently visited the North and claimed that the 31-year-old had undergone the operation at an exclusive hospital for high-ranking Communist Party members in Pyongyang. The source said that he had noticed a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward and said that bodyguards had been added as extra security.

Kim has not been seen in public since September 3, and his absence has prompted rampant speculation about his health. The whispers grew louder when he failed to attend a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly last week. The rumors reached a fever pitch Thursday when North Korea's state-run television station showed the man it calls the ""Great Successor"" limping and admitted that he was feeling unwell, an extraordinary move for the tightly-controlled propaganda unit.

A South Korean intelligence official told the Chosun Ilbo that Kim had initially sprained his ankle over the summer during a tour of military bases and factories and aggravated the injury by not undergoing treatment immediately. Kim has noticeably gained weight since succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il in 2011 and is rumored to be suffering from various ailments, including gout, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.

However, the South Korean intelligence official said that an attack of gout would not have been enough to keep him from the Supreme People's Assembly session, lending further credence to the surgery theory. The Chosun Ilbo had reported Monday that a team of doctors from France, Germany, and Russia had recently gone to North Korea.

542,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic State could target Britain with an EBOLA attack after two of the terror group's fighters reportedly contracted the deadly virus.

Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters.

They are believed to have unknowingly travelled from their African homelands with Ebola.

The news will spark fears that the jihadists could use the killer virus to hit Britain with so-called ""human-bug bombs"".

Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West.

Even if a calculated plot does not emerge, experts fear Ebola could be accidentally spread by IS — also known as ISIS and ISIL — should it tear through the group's ranks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was last night scrambling to uncover more information about the Iraqi infection claims.

WHO officials have offered to assist the Iraqi government in investigating any potential outbreak.

However, experts are concerned that the lack of resources and doctors — caused by IS's bloody campaign in Syria and Iraq — could make cases impossible to probe and treat.

IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul.

Meanwhile Western medics, who would normally travel to the Middle East to help, face terrifying risks of kidnap and beheading by IS.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday.

Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014.

Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" in Africa.

WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been ""no official notification"" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed.

The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country.

Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters’ symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers.

However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever.

They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising.

Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly.

He said: ""United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria.

""In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home.

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network’s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities.

However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

IS is a hardline jihadist group, which formerly had ties to al-Qaeda.

It seized vest swathes of Iraq and Syria in August in a bid to create a so-called caliphate.

MacRumors reports that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks ""Reset All Settings."" Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says; the iPhone's settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults. No media (music, photos, etc.) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action — that should only happen if you choose ""Erase All Content and Settings"" and wipe your phone entirely.

But something's clearly not right, with MacRumors reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple's iWork apps upon reset. They're also vanishing from OS X Yosemite, which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall. Right now, it's iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem. iCloud Drive is also available on Windows, but it's unclear if the issue has popped up there. It's also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
There's no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud. Apple added a ""recently deleted"" folder to Photos in iOS 8, but hasn't yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud. MacRumors notes the issue ""may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers"" and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug. But for now, the best option is avoiding ""Reset All Settings"" entirely until a fix is in place. We've reached out to Apple for clarification on just what's going on."
546,"American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley. 

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner. 

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said. 

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as ""The Beatles.""

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain's two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages. 

The Sunday Mirror, citing British intelligence sources, identified two other suspects as 20-year-old Abu Hussain al-Britani, originally from Birmingham, and 23-year-old Abu Abduallah al-Britani (no known relation), originally from the county of Hampshire on England's south coast. 

The Mail on Sunday reported that the three men known as ""John,"" ""George,"" and ""Ringo"" had formed a special kidnapping gang that may have targeted Westerners like Foley. The paper reported that the hostages regarded the group as particularly vicious jailers, who routinely beat their prisoners and tortured them with Tasers. At one point, the paper reported, the ""Beatles"" were actually prohibited from guarding the hostages due to the level of violence they inflicted.

According to The Mail on Sunday, the ""Beatles"" also boasted that they had made millions of dollars from ransoms paid by European countries, enough to ""retire to Kuwait or Qatar,"" as one hostage told the paper. 

The U.S. and Britain have a policy of not paying ransom to terrorist groups in exchange for captured citizens. However, other Western countries have no such policy. The New York Times reported last month that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have received at least $125 million in ransom money since 2008, paid by European countries like France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. 

Similarly, The Mail on Sunday reported that France had paid approximately $13.2 million for the release of four hostages held by ISIS earlier this year, while Italy had paid close to $5 million for the release of an Italian journalist. The release of seven other European journalists and aid workers reportedly cost a combined $26.5 million. Last week, the CEO of GlobalPost, a media organization where Foley had worked, revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of $132 million in exchange for Foley's release. 

In addition to Foley, ISIS is believed to be holding three other Americans hostage. One of them, journalist Steven Sotloff, is threatened with beheading by the militant known as ""John"" at the end of the video released last week.

The legitimacy of the note, which is noteworthy for its egalitarian tone, has been called into question – but there's good reason to believe it's real.

A photo of the note was posted to imgur yesterday by redditor fryd_, where it's received a lot of attention. It's also gained purchase on Twitter. As of this posting, this tweet by @henrywarren has been retweeted over three-thousand times:


Pretty great, right? We think so, too. So do a lot of other people. But the legitimacy of the note has been called into question. ""Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this,"" reads one of the top comments from the original post. On Twitter, others have flagged the note's typesetting and LEGO logo as anachronistic. At Boing Boing, Rob Beschizza wonders aloud how likely it is ""that Lego would have used a proportional Times-esque typeface—with such sloppy layout—in the early 1970s.""

There's also the lack of evidence from the original photographer, who writes:

I had no idea this would blow up so much, so didn't take more photos but this was at my partner's Grandma's house, on the back page of a pamphlet that came with a set from 73 she still has. There was a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house. Sorry I don't have more info...

Counterterrorism police and MI5 believe Bary is the person who appears in the video posted by ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, that shows the beheading of Foley last week.

""The MI5 investigation into the man behind James Foley's murder is ongoing but they have managed to identify the masked British jihadist who can be seen in the video holding a knife to his throat,"" the Sunday Times quoted a police source as saying.

Fox News reported that a ""senior Western intelligence official"" also confirmed that Bary is believed to be Foley's murderer, but U.S. intelligence officials are declining to comment.

Fox News said Bary's father was extradited from Great Britain to the U.S. in 2012 because of his connection with Osama bin Laden and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A source told Fox that the younger Bary went to Syria in 2013 to fight on the side of ISIS.

The Mirror reported that Bary was performing hip-hop music under the name L Jinny before leaving his parent's home to fight in Syria. Friends of Bary told the Mirror that the performer was radicalized from the teachings of preacher Anjem Choudary.

""He had the talent,"" one of his friends told the Mirror. ""He could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal. He was doing music with huge names in the underground scene. People have got into his head. It's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.""

The Mirror reported that Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, 23, from Portsmouth, are also being investigated.

A source told the Mirror that a team of soldiers are on the ground in Iraq and Syria looking to catch Foley's killer within the next few days. The source also said that British intelligence services believe it has a good beat on the identity of the British-born ""Jihadi John"" and manhunt efforts will turn him up."
552,"Computing giant Microsoft is one of the Silicon Valley companies that has hired robot security guards to protect and serve the streets around northern California's technology hub.

The Knightscope K5 robot security guards are fitted with lasers, GPS and heat-detecting technology, and can predict where criminals will strike next and the likelihood of future crimes.

Unlike human security guards, the egg-like Knightscopes are not armed(Knightscope)

The 5ft tall robots are designed to operate without human control and are equipped with surveillance cameras and sensors, a thermal imaging system, scanners that can read 300 car registration plates a minute, and odour detectors. It patrols the streets using lasers to gauge distance and a GPS system.

The robots analyse information from government, businesses and social media sources to predict the likelihood of a crime being committed in a given area, and decide whether the alert authorities it if comes across anything suspicious.

Four of the robot security guards have been deployed to guard Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus, in the system's first real mission.

It appears to be going well, although the robots have come unstuck in the face of a seemingly innocent adversary: steps.

Rachel Metz, a reporter for MIT Technology Review, said: ""I noticed that a K5 in the distance had somehow toppled over the edge of the sidewalk onto the parking-lot asphalt several inches below. A couple of Knightscope folks were needed to pull it upright.""

Well, if Doctor Who's mortal enemies can't handle stairs, what chance to these youngsters have?

553,"News of guitarist Willie Nelson’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the February 2015 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, the guitarist best known for hit songs like To All the Girls I've Loved Before or Pancho and Lefty is alive and well.

UPDATE 24/02/2015 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Willie Nelson death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the guitarist’s alleged demise gained traction on Sunday after a ‘R.I.P. Willie Nelson’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American guitarist’s passing:

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (February 22, 2015), our beloved guitarist Willie Nelson passed away. Willie Nelson was born on April 30, 1933 in Abbott. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 81-year-old guitarist and singer was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a guitarist of Willie Nelson's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (90%) of respondents think those Willie Nelson death rumors are not funny anymore.

Willie Nelson Death Hoax Dismissed Since Guitarist Is ‘Alive And Well’

On Monday (February 23) the guitarist's reps officially confirmed that Willie Nelson is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved guitarist. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.

554,"Swiss cheese, Cuban heels and a gruelling political schedule have been blamed for Communist leader's injury

Video loading

North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un has undergone a hospital operation after he fractured both ankles.

The 20-stone leader of one of the world’s most impoverished countries has soared on the scales due to his love of fine wine and dining.

Kim, believed to be aged 31, is under armed guard by his personal protection team at a hospital in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang.

One source in South Korea’s Seoul said there had been a marked increase in elite officials visiting the ward after Kim’s official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

Painful: Kim Jong-un is believed to insist on wearing Cuban heels for official duty to appear more of an authoritarian

The 31-year-old leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while studying in Switzerland and imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

One intelligence source said: “He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.”

Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment in a clip shown on North Korea’s Central TV.

There were earlier suggestions Kim’s obesity and binge drinking had brought on gout which confined him behind closed doors for several days.

But aides were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, with the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper saying he had “laboured on” by visiting various facilities in the hot summer weather.

Kim even missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday fuelling belief he was still confined to hospital.

Craving: The North Korean leader's love of cheese has led to rapid weight gain

A Seoul government official said it was unlikely “a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People’s Assembly just because he has gout.”

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state TV, which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

A team of doctors from Europe is also believed to have travelled to North Korea recently.

A political observer said ""coming down closer to the level of his people"" was the only way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles.

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea, with famines often breaking out in a country still relying on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

555,"Have you ever had your picture taken at an… unfortunate moment? Or worse yet, been caught on video when it really looked like you were doing something you weren’t? It doesn’t entirely matter what the confusion is, so much as people’s willingness to assume the worst, which is precisely what happened to a veteran meteorologist on national television over the weekend. But now, anchor Brian Williams has leapt in to save the day — he explained that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel wasn’t peeing in the snow while on-air with Lester Holt, despite how it may have looked, and he called for an apology for the confusion.

Seidel is no stranger to inclement and chaotic weather, as he’s been reporting out of extreme conditions for years. In this case, he was in the thick of a storm in North Carolina when, according to Williams, he lost his cell phone connection to the NBC studio, and thus didn’t realize he was live on-camera. And while he took off his gloves and fiddled with his phone to call them back, turned away from the camera, it painted a very particular picture — basically, it kinda looked like he was pissing in the snow, and that was all it took for social media to explode.


Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night. … that’s when the rumors hit that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow.
Of course, Williams is well-known to be a good sport with a decent sense of humor, so one hopes his request for an apology for Seidel isn’t too stern. Though really, it wouldn’t much help if it was — he’s calling for “social media” to apologize, after all, so good luck with that. Nor would it have been a big deal if he actually had been, ahem, “writing his name in the snow.” Because believe it or not, everybody has to go now and then, even the people on the TV. They’re just like us!


Notwithstanding however, Williams, NBC (and Seidel himself, one assumes) wanted to clear the air about this humble mix-up, and that’s all well and good. Unfortunately, it does steal away basically all the replay value of that misunderstood footage, though. If I wanted to watch somebody struggle to make a phone call with their back to me, I’d… well, I wouldn’t! Because I don’t want to see that, I just want to see weather reporters sneakily peeing in snow drifts. Is that so much to ask?

557,"Protesters march in support of the girls kidnapped by members of Boko Haram in front of the Nigerian Embassy in Washington on May 6.

The Nigerian government said Friday that it reached a cease-fire agreement with Boko Haram, the jihadist organization that kidnapped 219 girls in April, according to the AFP.

“A ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Boko Haram,” said Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s top military officer.

A second Nigerian official told AFP that the ceasefire would include provisions for the release of the kidnapped girls.

“They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” said Hassan Tukur, a secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan who served as the government’s representative in talks with Boko Haram.

But some experts questioned the credibility of the officials’ claims, in part because news of the agreement comes as President Jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid. Announcing the return of the girls, whose abduction inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, could help Jonathan’s electoral aspirations — even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true.

The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.

In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram’s representative in the talks.

“I have never heard of Ahmadu, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau,” Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP.

The Nigerian military has been fighting Boko Haram since 2009. Multiple attempts at reaching a cease-fire have proven unsuccessful."

According to the pair, Casey Dean, then 14, and 13-year-old Eduard Nitz stopped off at their local restaurant in the mid-90s to pick up some burgers.

In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.

He never turned up, instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next.

Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Mr Dean said.

""It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on The Project tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.

But common sense prevailed when the show’s hosts protested, and they left the decades-old meal for another day.

UPDATED: OK, we’re somehow supposed to live on earth eating sandwiches and believing that a man who walks like Paul Rudd, wears Paul Rudd’s face and (we assume) quacks like Paul Rudd is not actually Paul Rudd.

Vanity Fair reached out to the actor’s reps, who denied that the man in the video was Rudd. We’re calling shenanigans, because superheroes never want their true identities revealed.

So, update — wink wink, nudge nudge — the man in the video is definitely not Paul Rudd. Either that, or we have a much bigger clone problem on our hands than we initially assumed.

—

EARLIER: Look, we’ve always suspected that Paul Rudd was a super nice guy. While we would normally be suspicious of someone who doesn’t age (seriously, take a look at “Clueless” and then remember that was 19 years ago), his adorable stories about teenage kegger antics, being too ripped for his “Ant-Man” costume and punnily helping people announce their impending offspring help keep those suspicions at bay.

And now a new video, coupled with a little bit of investigative Twitter journalism (twournalism), really drives the point home, hard. Recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the Dallas airport, eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at. As he lashed out, a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground, restraining him until police could come and handcuff him. And guess what! One of those randos was none other than Paul Rudd.

Yep, keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket, jumping on and holding the dude down. Wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was Ant-Man himself.

Just add this incident to the growing list of reasons we suspect Rudd is an actual superhero."
562,"Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week."
564,"The gunman in a fatal shooting that rocked Ottawa on Wendesday has been identified.

Canadian officials told the AP that the shooter, who killed a soldier and wounded two other people near the Canadian Parliament building, is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was from Quebec and had recently converted to Islam, U.S. sources told Reuters. According to the Globe and Mail, he had been designated a ""high-risk traveler"" by Canadian officials and was barred from traveling outside the country.

After police chased him inside the Parliament building, Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sgt. at Arms Kevin Vickers.

Witnesses told the AP that Zehaf-Bibeau was wearing a scarf over his face when he opened fire in front of the Canadian War Memorial, which is across the street from Parliament.

The Canadian Broadcast Company released an image purported to be of the gunman:

BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj

— CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014

An Ottawa police spokesman told HuffPost that the police were looking for at least one other suspect. However, in a press conference later on Wednesday, officials declined to say if there were multiple possible shooters.

Wednesday's shooting quickly sparked terrorism fears. Just two days earlier, a Quebec man suspected of ties to radical Islam killed one soldier and wounded another with his car before being killed by police. As Reuters pointed out, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the attacker, was one of 90 people being monitored by Canadian national police over extremist beliefs.

Earlier this month, NBC News reported that the Canadian government was monitoring ""hundreds of people"" that it suspected could be planning to join ISIS. Anonymous officials told NBC that they were aware of several threats from ISIS supporters, but they said that none were substantial."

In December, the message was lost during a service upgrade, which left the 68-year-old Brit ""absolutely devastated"" and also ""extremely angry,"" according to the BBC. So he contacted Virgin Media to see if they could retrieve it and -- with the help of nearly a dozen engineers -- they did.

The virus, which has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa, is believed to have been brought to the city by jihadists from several different countries.

WHO spokesman Christy Feig confirmed that the health agency is reaching out to ISIS officials in the region to gather more information, The Daily Mail noted on Friday. Feig said that the Iraqi government hasn't yet responded to the news of possible Ebola cases in the country.

ISIS Executes Nearly 2,000 People in Syria in Six Months

An unconfirmed number of jihadists apparently sought treatment at the hospital in Mosul, which was captured by ISIS earlier this year. Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa.

As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure.

The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus.

ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas.

The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters.

The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak.

Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed.

It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.

Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014 — Nigeria experienced its own scare with Ebola after a number of cases of the virus were reported, but the country was declared Ebola-free by October."

Chandler said she met Phelps, 29, on Tinder in August. He eventually invited her over to his place in Baltimore to watch a Ravens game in September and that’s when things went to another level.
“One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,” she told Radar. “Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.”

Chandler said she did eventually come clean, or at least try to, by sending Phelps an email after he entered rehab in October following his arrest for drunk driving. He reportedly has yet to respond.
As for their future together, Chandler basically said she’s hopeful but not counting on anything.

569,"If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, they’ve just given it to you: they’ve declared war on Tor Browser.
Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an “illegal service.” The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies.
The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.
The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:
Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate,   fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.
How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users,  This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.
Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcast’s Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under “technical restrictions.”:
use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (“PremisesLAN”), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;
A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:
We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.
However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcast’s treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.
Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht’s internet usage. Ulbricht’s legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.
Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the “Six Strikes” plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the “Six Strikes” plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.

570,"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015."

572,"As a feel-good video of a generous homeless man continues to touch and move millions around the world, a California man has come forward to claim that the Internet prankster behind it faked a significant portion of the film, confirming our earlier suspicions.

In the video released last week, YouTube star Josh Paler Lin purports to give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it. Thomas walks right into a liquor store. But instead of alcohol, the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food, then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Apparently moved by the selfless act, Lin confronts Thomas and tells him that he’s being filmed.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

As of Tuesday morning, the video had racked up more than 27 million views on YouTube and inspired more than 150 glowing news articles from around the world. Following its success, Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to “help Thomas get a fresh start,” which has netted more than $127,000 in well-meaning donations from the public.

But now a nursing student from Anaheim has come forward to say there’s no way Thomas could have been secretly filmed—because he and Lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car. “The whole thing is bullshit,” says Taugan Tan Kadalim, who claims that on Dec. 20 he was outside the Euclid Liquor & Market, where the video’s pivotal scene is set. “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

The 26-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend, who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street. As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver’s seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s him,” says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin’s YouTube channel. “I couldn’t believe it.”

A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin’s car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.

What Kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video.

According to Kadalim, Lin hopped out of the car, went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier. While the two men chatted inside, Thomas waited with his bag by Lin’s car. Eventually, the prankster returned to his car, and a few minutes later, Thomas wandered into the liquor store. Several calls to Euclid Liquor & Market to confirm Kadalim’s account went unanswered.

“That was the last thing I remember seeing,” Kadalim says.

In the actual video, Thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks, and as he enters the store, Lin says to his cameraman, “Keep filming. Make sure he doesn’t see you.”

Kadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother, a fellow YouTube prank enthusiast. He shared the text with Vocativ, and the date and time stamps appear to match up. Kadalim’s girlfriend, who spoke on the condition that we not use her name, also corroborates the account.

“He told me that he had just run into some famous YouTube star while buying a lotto ticket,” she tells Vocativ. “Don couldn’t wait to watch the video.”

But when Kadalim did see the video, released on Dec. 22, he was floored.

“Bro, he drove Thomas to the liquor store,” he says. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Upset, Kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened. As the video started to go viral just before Christmas, he posted a comment to Lin’s YouTube channel explaining what he witnessed. His words, however, were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video.

“I’m not frustrated because he’s helping a homeless man and people love this video,” he says. “I’m frustrated because it’s dishonest and exploitive.”

Prior to Kadalim’s revelation, Lin told Vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted. “There is no way we’re making any of this up,” he said. “This is real.”

Subsequent attempts to reach Lin for further comment on Kadalim’s accusations were unsuccessful.

After the video went viral, Lin told us previously that he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he’d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin would not disclose. Lin has also refused all media requests to speak with Thomas, and he denied repeated requests from Vocativ to make Thomas available for an interview. At the same time, he’s been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man, including this “Xmas Surprise Makeover,” released Sunday.

Lin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works, in which he plans to surprise Thomas with all of the money that’s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked how the public could be certain those funds would actually go to Thomas, Lin told us that his lawyers, agent and manager have everything “covered.” When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are “confidential.” He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ."
573,"Thirty-year-old Dimitry Nikolaev, a married Russian television actor, was having a drink at a bar in Moscow after a theater performance when an attractive, blonde woman approached him. The unidentified woman invited him to accompany her to a sauna where, according to police reports, they drank beer and kissed before he blacked out. 

The next morning, Dimitry woke up at a bus stop to find that his phone, wallet, and testicles had all been stolen. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors informed him that the procedure must have been done by someone with medical knowledge, as the surgery was done skillfully and his sack was carefully sewn up again following the removal of his nuts. Police therefore believe this was probably a result of organ trafficking, as opposed to a vindictive crime. 

Russian newspaper Life News reports that the actor is having trouble figuring out how to explain the situation to his wife, and for now is simply telling her he is at the hospital for a ""serious illness."" Though given that the story is all over the media, it's likely she's learned the truth by now."
574,"Apple is reportedly relying on Samsung’s chip-building talents to mass-produce the brand-new chip in the Apple Watch as the device’s launch nears. The S1 system-in-package (SiP) that Apple was mostly secretive about during the smartwatch’s introduction contains various other components on top of Samsung’s chip, including mobile DRAM, NAND flash, and other peripheral chips, with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering providing the SiP modules.

FROM EARLIER: It looks like Samsung is finally developing a worthy rival for the Apple Watch and Moto 360

According to Digitimes’ sources, Samsung has won orders from Apple to make some 3,000 to 4,000 12-inch wafers each month, using its 28nm process technology, with the Apple Watch expected to launch at some point in March.

The Apple Watch is expected to become another important revenue source for Apple, though analysts disagree on the device’s sales performance in its first year. Some expect Apple to sell an impressive number of smartwatches by converting plenty of existing iOS users into first-gen Apple Watch buyers.

Samsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple WatchSamsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple Watch

Digitimes says that others have revised downward the number for first-gen Apple Watch shipments to as low as 10 million units for 2015, although they seem to be more optimistic on the device’s second-generation model that will presumably offer stronger battery life and other important improvements."
577,"French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be ""lucky"" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015. Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015."
578,"The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria posted a video on Tuesday that it said showed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago, according to a transcript released by the SITE Intelligence Group.

The authenticity of the video, which was also posted on YouTube, could not be verified, and a telephone call placed to Mr. Foley’s family was not immediately returned. YouTube later took down the four-minute, 40-second video.

The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013
Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

582,"The fat dictator is eyeing up locations as he looks to expand the state-backed chain of restaurants that started springing up in China and the rest of Asia before making their way to Europe.

It is believed the 32-year-old, who celebrated his birthday last week, is considering building a joint in Scotland, fuelled by the quest for independence north of the border and the communist country’s love of whisky.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, claimed Kim is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

“It would not surprise me at all if they opened a restaurant in Scotland”
Michael Madden
He said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opened a restaurant in Scotland.

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted the country into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky.”

It would be the second North Korean government restaurant to open in Europe after one popped up in Amsterdam in 2012.

The food outlets channel 30% of their takings back to the capital Pyongyang but critics think the cash will be trousered by Kim to fund his own lavish lifestyle.

As well as being hooked on whisky, Kim is addicted to Swiss Emmental cheese, which is partly to blame for his huge weight gain.

It is claimed he imports vast quantities of the fatty treat into North Korea at huge expense despite millions of his countrymen living in abject poverty.

Mr Madden said: “The restaurants are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

“They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run but they tailor the menus to suit.”

North Korea expert Jenny Town said she believed the country has “warmed” to Scotland in recent months.

She added: “North Korea is going to support any country that is struggling for independence as it continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy.”

583,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary has reportedly been identified the ISIS militant who beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video released this week.

Reports over the last several days had indicated that British intelligence forces were focusing in on the 23-year-old former London resident, who had achieved some fame in the UK for his rap career. Sources say that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left his family’s upscale home in London last year to join ISIS.

Bary is believed to have traveled to Syria, and recently tweeted a picture of himself holding a severed head.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary had a somewhat successful rap career, with some of his songs earning play on BBC radio. In early songs he made references to drug use and violence, as well as the threat of his family being deported to Egypt. His father, Adel Abdul Bary, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 and was believed to be a close lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.

“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In the James Foley beheading video, a masked executioner with a British accent read a statement warning the United States not to enter the conflict. The man later severed Foley’s neck with a knife and cut off is head.

Experts believe that British forces had likely identified Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary not long after the video was released.

Professor Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said authorities were likely quite familiar with the British suspect.

He said: “I’d be very surprised if they haven’t already narrowed it down to a small group of people.

“The video provides enough clues to show who is responsible. MI6 probably do have a rough idea already of where the hostages are. The intelligence agencies probably have it narrowed down to two or three people.”

British intelligence has not officially confirmed that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect in the James Foley beheading."

After several months of limbo after writer Aaron Sorkin finished the screenplay, production on Sony's Steve Jobs movie is picking up. Danny Boyle, who directed Slumdog Millionaire has been announced as the director of the film, and just last week, Sony signed on Christian Bale to play Jobs.

While the previous JOBS movie with Ashton Kutcher focused on Jobs' early life, Sony's film will use material from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography and will focus on three 30-minute scenes showing three of Apple's product launches.

Update: According to TheWrap, Rogen is not yet officially signed on, while Jessica Chastain is also being considered for an unspecified role in the film."
587,"The show was a global hit and Jess Smith became one of the most famous faces in the world - but for 19 years only her family ever knew it was her

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after she starred in the kids' show.

After 19 years, the student has finally broken her silence and outed herself as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.

She was selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.

The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family ever knew it was her.

There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed her secret past during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Jess said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.

""My mother is really chuffed.""

The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""I am the sun from Teletubbies.

""There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

Sensation: The Teletubbies gang Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po

Jess added: ""I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face.""

Jess' name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliver father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.

""It was really weird seeing her on television.""

588,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron denounced the Islamic State (IS) jihadist organisation as “monsters” Sunday after the Foreign Office said a video showing the murder of a British aid worker appeared to be authentic.

""All the signs are that the video is genuine, we have no reason to believe that it's not,"" a spokesman for the Foreign Office told AFP.

The video showing the beheading of David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, was released by IS militants late Saturday. It was the third beheading of a Western hostage by the group in less than a month.

After chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee Sunday, Cameron condemned IS, which has conquered vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the ""embodiment of evil"" and vowed that the UK would do everything possible to find Haines’s killers.

""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes,"" the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from Downing Street.

He continued: ""Step by step we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (IS) and what is stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination.

""We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region.""

US President Barack Obama said after the killing that the United States would stand with Britain in an expanded effort against the terror group.

“We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,” he said.

No comment on air strikes

Haines, 44, had been taken hostage in Syria in March 2013 while working for the French NGO ACTED, which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and rebel groups, including IS, seeking to oust him.

Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a ""British hero"", saying that ""his selflessness, his decency, his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life"".

Those who killed him ""are not Muslims, they are monsters"", he said.

Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq, and for President Obama's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists.

But despite growing calls at home for action against IS, Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes.

London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq, but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy.

During a visit to Berlin this week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria, after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country.

But just hours later, a spokesman for Cameron's Downing Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out.

In the footage of Haines’s murder, a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United States and says the alliance will drag the British people into ""another bloody and unwinnable war"".

‘Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished’

In a statement, ACTED said it was “deeply appalled and horrified” by the murder.

“David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border,” it said.

“David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him, notably for his generosity, commitment, and his professionalism.

“The horrible assassination of David, an aid worker, goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity. This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished.”

Before joining ACTED, Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap International, which helps the disabled during conflicts, and Nonviolent Peaceforce, which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones. He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South Sudan.

His brother, Mike Haines, said he had also worked for the United Nations in the Balkans “helping people in real need”.

“His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,” Mike Haines said. “He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.”

589,"The reveal of the Apple Watch was unusual for Cupertino, which has traditionally announced products that are ready to launch. We won't be seeing the smarwatch until next year, and Apple is still keeping a few of the details under wraps, including the specs and price.

But one source claims to know what the internals of the smartwatch will be. The word comes from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, who quotes a source from Apple's supply chain.

Apparently, the component creators believe the wearable will pack in 512MB of RAM and offer 4GB of RAM as standard, which puts it on an equal footing with the top Android Wear devices out there right now, such as the Samsung Gear 2 and the LG G Watch R.

Arcuri also says that Apple might be offering an 8GB version of the watch as well, though it's unclear whether this information also comes direct from the source - or whether it's speculation on his part.

Juice it up

Finally, Arcuri also says he expects the Apple Watch to feature a wireless chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 5S, which actually included a GPS radio. However, that would contradict Apple, which stated that the Watch will need an iPhone in order to use GPS, so we'd say it's less likely.

Speaking of chips, Chipworks has provided a visual teardown of the Apple Watch internals, and it reckons it's spotted the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip that Cupertino has chosen for its debut wearable.

The important takeaway point is that, if Chipworks is right, the BCM4334 chip used will mean the watch should offer minimal power consumption in the connectivity department.

However, the word right now is that Apple's smartwatch battery will last a day in its current state, so the company might have to look elsewhere in the watch if it wants to insert a little more juicepower before launch.

Apple's watch is still in prototype right now but we don't expect too many of the specs to change before next year. If anything does, we really, really hope it's the battery life."
591,"(CNN) -- Scratch Christian Bale off the list of actors supposed to play Steve Jobs.

Bale was rumored to be the finalist to play the Apple co-founder in the Aaron Sorkin-written film biography but decided he wasn't right for the part, said The Hollywood Reporter.

The Jobs biopic has been in the works since at least 2012, when Sony announced that Sorkin would write a film based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography.

Bale is the second notable performer to turn down the Jobs role. Leonardo DiCaprio was also pegged for the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that neither Bale nor DiCaprio had begun negotiations.

According to Variety, Seth Rogen is being talked about for the part of Steve Wozniak, Jobs' Apple co-founder.

The film is to be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Filming was scheduled to begin this winter."

593,"A PGA Tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for PED use. 

Tiger Woods has had a tough career as of late, plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing, and now that he’s taken “a leave of absence” until his golf game is “tournament ready,” he’s facing criticism.

This criticism blew up Monday morning when professional, but not well-known PGA Tour golfer Dan Olsen went on a radio interview with David “Mad Dog” DeMarco on 730 WVFN’s The Game in Lansing, MI and claimed that Tiger Woods is serving a suspension for using PEDs.

“I heard he’s on a month suspension,” Olsen said. “And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

WOW. Dan Olsen, who are you?

Olsen’s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he’s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven’t been evidenced by anything or anyone else.

As if this wild claim wasn’t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now,” Olsen said. “One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn’t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater.

It’s a tough claim to believe, and one you don’t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he’s done he’ll be remembered as the best.

Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn’t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven’t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he’s gone through it his whole career.

The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can’t discount them completely. We’ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true."
595,"Multiple users of anonymous Web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their Internet service unless they stop using the legal software. 

According to a report on DeepDotWeb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor “illegal” and told customers that using it is against the company’s policies.

Tor is a type of Web browser that, in theory, makes all your Internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected Internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your Internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hit men.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn’t illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the Web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an “illegal service.” One Comcast representative, identified only as “Kelly,” warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

“Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at any time due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.”

Comcast customers, speaking to DeepDotWeb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to DeepDotWeb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor Internet traffic in case it receives a court order:

“We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.”"

599,"SYDNEY - A girlfriend of Michael Phelps has revealed that she was born and brought up a man, reports said on Thursday.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, who dated the 29-year-old US swimmer for months, wrote a long post on her Facebook page on Nov 14 in which she revealed that she was ""born intersex and named David Roy Fitch"" at birth.

""I was born with male genitalia with no testicles, but I also have a uterus and no ovaries,"" the 41-year-old told Radar Online in an interview.

She also said that she has always felt like a woman, and underwent surgery in her teens to become one.

In her post, she said she has dated many celebrities, none of whom knew about her past.

Chandler met Phelps on dating app Tinder, and was with the Olympian when he was arrested for drink driving on Sep 30.

He has been suspended from competition and checked himself into a rehabilitation facility in October.

Chandler said she did not tell Phelps about her complicated past, but has emailed him about it after his arrest.

""I never lied to him,"" Chandler said. ""We were together for such a short period of time, I never had a chance to tell him about my life.""

She also told Radar Online that the intimacy she felt with Phelps was ""amazing"" and it was the first time ""someone has made me feel like a real woman"".

She said it's not clear if they will still be together after his rehabilitation.

""Michael is a brand, and dating someone like me may not be the best thing,"" she told Radar Online. ""I just hope he follows his heart and not what his people tell him.""

After tabloid magazine the National Enquirer featured Chandler on its cover with the headline ""Michael Phelps new girlfriend was born a man"", she has lashed out on social media, objecting to being called ""a man"".

600,"Abuja (AFP) - Nigeria on Friday claimed to have reached a deal with Boko Haram militants on a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls but doubts immediately surrounded the purported breakthrough.

Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh told senior military officials from Nigeria and Cameroon meeting in Abuja that a ""ceasefire agreement"" had been concluded between the government and the insurgents.

""I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development,"" he added.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April.

But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution.

Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost.

Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad.

""I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,"" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government.

Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau.

""Government wants to negotiate,"" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, ""but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.""

- Chad talks -

Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby.

""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening.

""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage.

Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions.

The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year.

The release of the hostages last weekend was ""a first strong signal"" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls.

- Discrepancies -

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's ""chief security officer"" and in charge of publicity.

He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term.

The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"".

He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.

Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.

Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.

Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.

But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace."
601,"An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet. But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all.

The blast left a hole 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 19 feet (5 meters) deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua's capital. Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby.

But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid, dubbed 2014 RC, which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend. About the size of a house, 2014 RC passed within 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) of our planet on Sunday.

""Information is limited, but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact"" at the Managua crater, says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel, by email.

Managua Meteorite?

Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight. In some news reports, geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact.

However, NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans, author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn't caused by an impact.

""This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated,"" says Yeomans, because the Earth moves about 870,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) in 13 hours. ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

Russian Roulette

Meteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past, most notably in the February 15, 2013, Chelyabinsk impact, which damaged buildings across central Russia. (See ""Chelyabinsk Meteor: The Animated Movie."")

That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia, with about 500 kilotons of energy, bright enough to sunburn some watchers. A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date.

Update: In a late Monday report on RC 2014, astronomers at NASA's Near-Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, revised size estimates for the asteroid. Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet (12 meters) across and rotates rapidly, several times a minute. That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite.

The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua ""unrelated"" to RC 2014, citing the 13-hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion. ""As yet, no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater,"" noted the statement."
603,"A catholic priest from Masschussetts, who was reported dead for close to an hour before medics were able to revive him, has made a shocking revelation upon his return to life.

The 71-years old priest, identified as, Father John Micheal O’neal, claims he went to heaven and met God, whom he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting, she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace.

‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!’

Despite the shocking revelation, which is being received with a bit of confusion in the Catholic world, Father O’neal says he still wishes to continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ‘Holy Mother’.

‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman,’ he said.

With his new outlook, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is yet to confirm if Father O’neal will be permitted to resume preaching in his former parish in South Boston or not.

Father John Micheal O’neal, who was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital on Thursday, January 29, 2015, was revived through the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, which kept the blood flowing to his brain as doctors managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm, after a major heart attack.

The Telegraph reported Tuesday that Woods' former 62-acre island in Lake Malaren, Sweden, has been put on the market. 

The listing agent for Vladi Private Islands says the island, about an hour from Stockholm, features one golf hole in addition to a “mini mansion,” secluded villa, hunting lodge, private barber and landing strip for propeller planes. How convenient! 

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods,” the listing agent said, “but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden anymore. This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. … 

“The protected location, combined with the quay’s generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.”

607,"If we've learned anything in 2014, it's that teenagers are to be both feared and revered. In a profile published over at New York magazine, one 17-year-old New Yorker confirms that he made $72 million trading stocks during his lunch break at his high school. Someone please send help!!!!

Mohammed Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants who live in Queens. He attends Stuyvesant High School in downtown Manhattan. And now he is richer than all of us by an unfathomable margin. The profile of Islam doesn't seem willing to explain where he got the money to begin investing (there is a mention of earning tutoring money when he was nine) but it does show that teens are just as ridiculous and spunky whether they have a few bucks allowance or $72 million in investments:

Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. ""He's quiet today,"" said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. ""Humble."" And tired: ""This is our third meeting of the day,"" Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. ""We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …""

""Next we're going to see a hedge-fund guy,"" Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.

""He basically wants to give us $150 million,"" Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.

The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. ""Freshly squeezed apple juice,"" Damir said, passing them around. ""It's very good. Do you like caviar?""

New York magazine confirmed that Islam's net worth is in the high eight figures. The teen made his money trading in oil and gold but he won't stop there. Though his parents won't let him move into his rented Manhattan apartment and he can't drive his newly purchased BMW (no driver's license just yet), Islam and his team of three teen Wall Street JV investors plan on starting a hedge fund together in a few months.

As they nobly point out, teens get the money:

""Money never sleeps!"" Damir added. ""That's from the Wall Street movie.""

""It all comes down to this,"" Mo continued. ""What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don't keep going, there's no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.""

What were you doing as a teenager hey don't answer that.

610,"On Friday, Esquire published an article titled “ESPN Has A Problem With Women” that suggests the network was planning to host a male-only panel discussion on domestic violence during this week’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast.

The article begins:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

The assertion that ESPN would host such a panel discussion and not invite any women to participate sparked outrage.

THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/lasYPHtbXl

Utterly speechless. RT @Lahlahlindsey THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/ycDWFvwtfI …

Chris Berman and Mike Ditka, who are not good at talking about *football,* talking about domestic violence? This has a chance to be A+ TV.

Several other blogs wrote posts questioning why ESPN would only let men participate in this domestic violence discussion. (H/t Deadspin)

ESPN Doesn’t Get It: They Ignore Women’s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence

ESPN’s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important

11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight’s ESPN Domestic Violence Panel

Esquire writer Ben Collins who posted the original article took to Twitter to attempt to clarify what he wrote.

Hi, everybody now reading my ESPN story @Lahlahlindsey's tweet! Note: There's no special panel on tomorrow's Countdown for domestic violence

...Those are the people on the show every week. They haven't changed it in the last few weeks, either. Don't know if that's better or worse.

But there was a top sentence left off that tweet that's going around, and I wanted to clarify. ESPN is mad enough at me as it is. Thank you.

On Monday, ESPN’s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire’s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.

ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.

ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story.

ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.

Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.

Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment."
611,"OTTAWA – The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick’s lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

“MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms,” tweeted New Democrat Craig Scott.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino tweeted: “I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”"
612,"The proposal went off with a different kind of bang than Dim Xiong Chien had expected when his fireworks set the college ablaze

A blundering Romeo who wanted to propose to his girlfriend with a big bang burnt down his college when fireworks he took to mark the event set fire to dry grass.

Dim Xiong Chien, 22, had taken three large boxes of fireworks onto campus where he planned to set them off as he got down on one knee and popped the question to girlfriend Cong Yen, 22.

But when she forgot to turn up he set them off anyway hoping she would see them and go and see what was happening.

When Chien's girlfriend did not turn up he lit the fireworks anyway, hoping she would see them and come to see what was happening

Pal Shin Tan, 21, said: ""He had prepared this big event in secret and had told her to meet him by the sports ground for a romantic walk.

""She had no idea he was planning to propose though, and clearly forgot all about the walk.""

As firemen rushed to the scene to put out the three-metre high flames on the grass, gutted Chien went looking for forgetful Yen.

He said: ""I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn’t shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire.

""When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.

""But as we approached the sports hall we saw all these flames and firemen and I decided to postpone the proposal to another date.""

Bewildered Yen told local TV: ""I found out later that he wanted to ask me to marry him.

""Of course, I love him, but my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can’t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.""

It took firemen over an hour to extinguish the blaze at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China's Liaoning province.

A college spokesman said: ""The hall is covered by insurance and we have yet to make a decision about how to punish this student."""
614,"Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?
Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of ""The Newsroom"" and ""The West Wing.""
The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.
Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's ""Jobs"" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), ""iSteve"" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.
On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, ""Steve Jobs""—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.
If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.
""It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy—part hero, part antihero,"" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.
""I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,"" Sorkin said in a separate interview.
Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.
Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in ""The Revenant."" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

616,"Breaking news on Sunday morning reports that senior western intelligence officials confirm that the London rapper is the major suspect in the beheading of James Foley. The London rapper, Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, is the 23-year-old man believed to have beheaded Foley on the video that was seen worldwide last week, according to Fox News on Aug. 24.

Bary, who was big into the London rap scene was heard on the BBC radio with his music, but he left London last year to go to Syria and fight with the ISIS. Bary is identified as one of the group that consists of at least three British-born ISIS fighter, dubbed “The Beatles.”

The Israel Times reports today that Bary’s songs were featured on BBC radio in the past, as he was at one time a popular rapper going by the name Jinn Matic. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today.

Britain used high tech voice recognition to identify “Jihadi John,” the man seen in the video with Foley, reports the Telegraph. Bary’s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many.

Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. Barry was seen early this month on YouTube holding the severed head of one of his victims, so there’s no question about him being very capable of what many see as pure evil. The beheading of James Foley is not the end of the violence from this group warn officials."

The World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Iraq made that clear in a statement late Monday, saying there are no suspected infections from the deadly virus in the country. That came after rumors spread online and through several media outlets on Dec. 31. Most of them cited anonymous medical sources in the city of Mosul, which has been under the control of Islamic State militants since June.

The virus spreading through Iraq would have raised concerns for both the local population and American troops who recently began training the Iraqi military. According to the discredited reports, the virus was said to have been brought to Iraq by militants and other migrants coming to the country from Africa.

Health officials said that simply isn’t true. The Ministry of Health and World Health Organization investigated the reports through surveillance networks and contacts with medical sources in Mosul, and found that there were no cases of the virus.

“The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus,” according to the joint statement–a question that was raised by skeptics when the rumors spread last week.

Here’s a sampling of tweets on the rumors before the announcement:

621,"A Sept. 8 U.S. Department of Defense news article talking about the success of airstrikes in Iraq mentions a question from the media — and answer — about the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

From the article:

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

622,"Breaking!  J.J. Abrams has reportedly approached Disney about moving up the Star Wars: The Force Awakens release date. This comes from the mouth of Abrams himself, addressing a group of attendees at a recent industry event, the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards… this is awards season after-all. Apparently, his desire for secrecy does not apply in this case, as he openly expressed his frustration about the Episode VII leaks.

Adamant about the project’s secrecy, Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously and is looking at a possible summer release. This would put Star Wars up against other giant franchise releases, namely Jurassic World and Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron. Does this make sense for Star Wars' highly anticipated return to the silver-screen?

Earlier this week, Disney issued a subpoena over Star Wars: The Force Awakens leaked photos. This indicates that the company is taking measures to prevent further leaks, making Abrams’ desire to move up the current December 18th, 2015 opening date a very real scenario.



Does this mean we are in the final stages of post-production? How far along is the marketing and promotional art? When will we see the new toys and merchandise? As usual, it’s too soon to celebrate and we now have more questions than before we started.

625,"Scottish people have some of the strongest stomachs in the world – but even they may struggle with a restaurant from cheese-obsessed North Korean lardball Kim Jong-Un.

The waddling dictator has already opened branches of the Pyongyang restaurant in China and Holland – with some serving delicacies such as dog-meat soup and a bottled aphrodisiac allegedly made from bears.

Next to that lot, deep fried Mars bars and a national dish made from sheep’s bowels sounds positively delicious.

Kim is alleged to be eyeing up Scotland because of his love of whisky – which is so popular in his communist dictatorship it’s sometimes used instead of money.

The podgy autocrat also admires Alex Salmond’s attempt to break free of English control last year.

While that is something that Scots might be able to get on board with, it’s debatable whether they’ll share Kim’s taste in food, with Western Pyongyang outlets serving ‘delicacies’ such as pine nut gruel.

MORE: Puppies are rescued from tiny cages in Korean dog-meat farm

MORE: Google thinks photoshopped picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in drag is his younger sister

The key question may be whether Kim offers Irn Bru alongside the ginseng wine offered in other Pyongyang outlets.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

‘The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

‘Despite voting No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.’

One of the restaurants has already opened in Holland.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, added: “They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

‘They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

‘But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog!’"
626,"The suitcase held a number of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, food bowl and food

A shar-pei cross has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase with his belongings.

The dog, named Kai, was tied to a railing outside Ayr station in Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA (Scotland’s Animal Welfare Charity) is appealing for information.

A statement from the SPCA said: ""Regardless of the act Kai was left with his belongings, this was a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible.""

The suitcase held a number of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, food bowl and food.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.""

Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.

Inspector Taylor added: ""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about."""
628,"In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers. Only one escaped their teenage hunger...

Two Australian men claim to have the oldest burger in the world - at a staggering 20 years old.

In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers.

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger. Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

“We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,” Mr Dean said.

ahmerkhokhar.com   Longevity: The pair brought the snack for a mate 20 years ago

“It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we’d hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.”

But the hardy burger is not the only long-lived Maccy D’s in existence.

The last McDonald's cheeseburger ever sold in Iceland is still going strong and mould-free – six years after it was bought by a burger-lover.

The fast-food giant shut up shop in Iceland in 2009 because it said the country's financial crisis had made it too expensive to operate.

630,"BEIRUT—Former Iraqi military officers who have joined Islamic State are training pilots to fly three captured Syrian military jets, a monitoring group said Friday.

The officers, who served in the Iraqi military during the 24-year rule of Saddam Hussein, are conducting the training at the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo in northern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The Observatory, citing unnamed sources, said the aircraft were believed to be MiG-21s and MiG-23s that were seized at Syrian air bases in the provinces of Aleppo and Raqqa after the bases were captured by Islamic State forces. The organization didn’t report what weaponry, if any, the aircraft were carrying.

The claims, which the Observatory said were based on eyewitness reports to monitors, couldn’t be independently confirmed.

The Observatory is a U.K.-based group that has a network of antigovernment activists in Syria who supply accounts on fighting in the country, now in the fourth year of a civil war."
632,"Extremist group the Islamic State claims to have executed American journalist James Foley, who was abducted in Syria in 2012. The FBI is evaluating a video that was posted online Tuesday, purporting to show Foley's beheading.

That video was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday afternoon and later removed. The images show a man resembling Foley kneeling next to a masked militant, reciting comments against the U.S. before being killed.

U.S. officials tell the Associated Press that Islamic State had recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge U.S. airstrikes that have helped Iraqi forces regain key sites, including the Mosul dam.

The Islamic State also says it's holding another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in Syria last year, and that Sotloff could be the next victim.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says U.S. officials are studying the video to determine whether it's genuine:

Foley has been missing since November of 2012, when he was kidnapped while reporting in Syria for the news organization GlobalPost. A Facebook page was later created to call for his return; last night, it posted this statement from Foley's mother, Diane:

GlobalPost notes that, ""The Foley family has not received confirmation of Jim's death from the U.S. government, and acknowledged that there is still a small chance the video of his apparent killing will prove to have been fake.""

The company's CEO and co-founder, Philip Balboni, says GlobalPost had been working to learn who kidnapped Foley, and where he was being held captive.

""Although GlobalPost's investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic militants in Syria,"" Balboni said. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.""

Foley was on a freelance assignment for GlobalPost when he was abducted in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He had been making his way to the Turkish border when he was stopped by a group of armed men, the organization says.

Back in 2011, Foley was one of three journalists who were held captive for more than a month after being attacked by Gaddafi fighters near Benghazi. A fourth journalist didn't survive the attack.

Their ordeal led Foley and one of his colleagues, American Claire Gillis, to visit NPR's Talk of the Nation back in 2011. Discussing the uncertain weeks of their captivity, Foley said they ""turned to a lot of prayer"" and exercise. In the end, he was the last of the journalists to be released, after spending a week as the sole Westerner in the prison.

""I started to have some dark thoughts,"" he said. ""I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole... I thought maybe I was going to be a bargaining chip."""
633,"Knightscope co-founder Stacy Stephens said rumors that its K5 security robots are roaming Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus are not true.

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""So people started snapping photos,"" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners – but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"" Stephens said. ""But we have not deployed there.""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

""They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'"" Stephens said.

""Unfortunately, that's what people get for not calling us up to confirm things,"" he added.

So, sorry Microsoft employees. It looks like no robots will be watching over your car in the parking lot — for now."

636,"Eleven Iraqi police officers were taken to hospital after an ISIS chemical weapons attack, with the Defense Ministry and doctors recently confirming the gas as chlorine. This marks the first officially documented militant attack with the chemical.

The Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants’ chlorine gas attack occurred on September 15, in the town of Duluiyah, located north of the capital, according to a Washington Post report.

The blast followed an exchange of fire between the militants and the members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, who were guarding the town’s borders.

“It was a strange explosion. We saw yellow smoke in the sky,” said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, one of the survivors.

The victims talked of the fog that hung close to the ground – a possible indication that it was chlorine, which is heavier than air.

The physicians who treated them also confirmed that their diagnosis was poisoning by chlorine gas.

“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, director of the hospital in the nearby city of Balad, where the officers were taken. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”

Image from Google MapsImage from Google Maps

A recent statement from the Iraqi Defense Ministry said that the IS had used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” – in roadside bomb attacks and near several water treatment plants where it had gained access to chlorine. Without indicating the locations of the attacks, the statement said that the militants aimed at impairing “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular.”

American defense officials were not aware of the September 15 chlorine attack and referred to the Iraqi government for further information.

Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, told the New York Times on Thursday, “The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region.”

There have lately been several reports of IS militants using chlorine gas on the battlefield, however, none had been officially confirmed. They appeared after the jihadists seized a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant this summer, whose 2,500 degraded rockets the Iraqi officials claimed unlikely to be fit for use.

Earlier this week, reports were circulating that there was a chemical attack in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on Tuesday. But the chemical agent the IS militants used couldn’t be identified, as doctors lacked necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of complaints made by Kurdish victims and activists.

As a choking agent, chlorine was widely used during World War I. Nowadays it is sold legally as a key component in industry, but its use as a chemical weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention."
638,"Claim: The town of Purdon, Texas was quarantined after a family of five there tested positive for the Ebola virus.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, October 2014]

News report of family of 5 in Purdon, Texas tested positive for Ebola. Town is quarantined.

Origins: On 14 October 2014, the National Report published an article claiming that the town of Purdon, Texas, had been quarantined after a local family of five tested positive for Ebola. Purdon is located 70 miles from Dallas, the city in which Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan died of the disease. Shortly after Duncan's death, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) disclosed that a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had contracted the hemorrhagic virus while caring for Duncan.

The National Report article referenced both the death of Duncan and the illness of nurse Nina Pham as context for the claim about a quarantine in Purdon:

639,"The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

The monarch may personally take part in bombing raids on extremist strongholds on Thursday, according to reports in Arabic-language newspapers.

It comes after the former general told members of Congress that he was ready to exact a blistering revenge against the ISIS terror army for the brutal execution of military pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh - and he quoted a Clint Eastwood movie character to make his point.

Jordan's King Abdullah (pictured), a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed

Uncompromising language; King Abdullah of Jordan, (center), is hurried into a meeting with leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the Capitol in Washington after shocking footage of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive was released online Tuesday

According to the dailycaller, reports have emerged suggesting he could take part in airstrikes on ISIS targets today.

California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Washington Examiner that the king quoted the scene where Eastwood's character announces his plan for retribution.

'Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him,' Eastwood's William Munny says in 'Unforgiven.'

'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.'

'He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen,' Hunter said. 'He's angry. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, ""The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets"".'

'He's ready to get it on. He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.'

Last-minute meeting: Jordan's King Abdullah II (left) met with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday after video emerged showing the brutal execution of one of his country's pilots by the ISIS terrorist group

Brutal: Footage titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show captured airman Moaz al-Kassasbeh wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is set alight

Hunter told the Examiner that no one in the king's meeting on Tuesday with members of the House Armed Services Committee made any mention of President Obama, who is seen by some anti-ISIS coalition partners as a weak and indecisive actor.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after a separate meeting with the king that Jordan would have a 'strong and forceful' response to the the fiery execution.

'The Jordanian response will be more engaged, not less engaged, when it comes to destroying ISIL,' Graham said.

'The king feels that the gloves are off and that it now is time if you can't negotiate with these people, you're going to have to take it to them, and I think it's going to be more than Jordan.'

Obama and Abdullah met Tuesday evening in a hastily arranged meeting just hours after a grisly video emerged showing al-Kassasbeh, who was 26 years old, being burned alive in a cage by ISIS.

They emerged from the meeting, vowing to continue their fight of the extremist group gaining control over large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

In addition, the State Department said Tuesday that the administration will increase its annual aid to Jordan to $1 billion from $660 million to help it pay for the cost of housing refugees from Iraq and Syria – and provide new resources to fight ISIS.

An agreement on the aid will require congressional approval.

In a brief statement, the U.S. State Department said it planned to provide $1 billion per year to Jordan for each of the U.S. fiscal years for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The U.S. fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him

Al-Kassasbeh was captured in December when his F-16 jet crashed over northern Syria, a mission that was part of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against the jihadists.

During the meeting, President Obama offered 'his deepest condolences' to the king over the pilot's death

'The president and King Abdullah reaffirmed that the vile murder of this brave Jordanian will only serve to steel the international community's resolve to destroy ISIL,' said White House spokesman Alistair Baskey.

Obama earlier decried the 'cowardice and depravity' of the Islamic State, saying the brutal killing would only strengthen international resolve to destroy the extremists.

The White House would not speculate on whether the video was released to coincide with Abdullah's visit to Washington, where he was not scheduled to meet Obama.

The president said First Lieutenant Kassasbeh's 'dedication, courage and service to his country' represented 'universal human values that stand in opposition to the cowardice and depravity of ISIL.'

'Today, we join the people of Jordan in grieving the loss of one of their own,' the president added, as his administration reaffirmed its intention to give Jordan $3 billion in security aid over the next three years.

'As we grieve together, we must stand united, respectful of his sacrifice to defeat this scourge,' Obama said after the latest in a wave of grizzly filmed murders.

Jordanian state television said that Kassasbeh was killed on January 3.

The slaying would redouble international commitment to ensure the Islamic State group 'are degraded and ultimately defeated,' said Obama.

The extremists seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria last year, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and committing a wave of atrocities.

Countries as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Jordan responded with 'Operation Inherent Resolve,' an air-led campaign to pummel the jihadist group.

US Central Command meanwhile admitted that the Islamic State still had the ability 'to conduct small-scale operations,' despite months of air strikes.

But, it said, 'their capacity to do so is degraded and their momentum is stalling.'

Attacks have hit the group's 'ability to command and control forces; recruit, train and retain fighters, produce revenue from oil sales, and maintain morale.'

Islamic State had offered to spare Kassasbeh's life and free a Japanese journalist in return for the release of a female would-be suicide bomber on death row in Jordan.

Jordanian officials announced the female bomber and other jihadists would be executed on Wednesday."
643,"When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch, the unveiled three different editions: the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition. The latter model appears to be catered to those who are more interested in fashion and luxury as the watch will be given an 18-karat gold treatment.
Sure, we guess it looks good but at the same time, have you ever wondered how much it will cost? Apple has declined to state a price of the Apple Watch Edition but according to the folks at TechCrunch, it is possible that the gold Apple Watch could retail for as much as $1,200. This is according Chad Rickicki, a watch expert who claims that the 18-karat gold Apple Watch would cost $600 just for the case, size, and shape alone, and that combine it with the electronics and markup, could end up being in the $1,200 range.
This is a significant leap over the base Apple Watch which Apple has said would be priced starting at $349, so safe to say it is an interesting direction that Apple is headed if they do indeed price the Edition at over $1,000. Given how Apple’s recent hires have come from the high-end fashion industry, we can’t say this is too surprising.
In fact a rumor earlier this year had even suggested that Apple could be preparing an Apple Watch that could cost thousands, thus making these claims slightly more believable. Either way we expect Apple will announce the prices in the near future as the Apple Watch has currently been pegged for a release in 2015."
645,"The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed ""back of envelope"" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: ""[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being ""solid gold,"" it does say it is ""crafted from 18-karat gold,"" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. ""There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. ""The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."" Gold straps Gruber says a ""starting price"" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition ""is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

Its headline now reads ""Satirical news site attacks China’s weird English names"" and the story characterizes the CCTVnews.cn story as ""a humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcater CCTV.""

649,"A student has broken a 19-year silence and revealed she was the iconic sun baby in hit TV show Teletubbies.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, Kent, was selected to be the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old.

The show was a global hit and Miss Smith, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family knew it was her.

Jess Smith (pictured left and right as a baby) was chosen as the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old - but kept her role a secret for 19 years

There were rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.'

Miss Smith revealed her secret during a game with her university friends where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess - she is pictured left and right as the smiling sun baby

She then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: 'So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

'I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

'I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.'

Miss Smith is now a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University

Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.'

Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith.

She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is.

'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby.

'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends.

'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.'

She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child.

'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me.

'My close friends and family knew, but it just never interested me before to tell everyone.

'At uni we had to tell the person sitting next to us something about ourselves so I thought I would say it.

'Then people from uni convinced me to tell everyone and they encouraged me through it all.

'I am proud. I wouldn't change it for anything.

'My family will all remember it for ever. My nan has articles about me when I was baby all over her wall.'

As no one could predict the success of Teletubbies (pictured) Jess was paid £250 and given a box of toys

Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

Miss Smith (pictured left) with a friend, said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250

'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.'

Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250.

The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV.

She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys.

'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. '

She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.'

Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part.

The BBC is preparing to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular 90s children's television show."
650,"An Indian man had his penis cut off with a meat cleaver by a vigilante group, after attempting to rape a teenage girl.

The 40-year-old rapist, Suresh Kumar, was beaten with sticks for about an hour before his genitals was cut off.

The incident occurred in the city of Ganganagar, where Kumar was left bleeding as his penis and testicles lay on the road next to him.

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime. We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.”

The police, has however, urged those responsible for the castration to come forward and submit themselves for prosecution.

A police spokesman said, “People cannot take the law into your own hands. As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”"
651,"Never one known for restraint, Vice Media’s Shane Smith may now have outdone even himself.

Mr. Smith, the chief executive of the provocative news and entertainment group, spent $300,000 for a dinner at the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio in Las Vegas during the International CES trade show in January, according to one person who was at the party and another one who knew about it.

Mr. Smith, whose company closed financing last September that valued it at $2.5 billion, paid for the meal personally. More than 30 people were at the dinner, including friends, other Vice executives and staff members and directors like Tom Freston, a founder and former chief executive of MTV who later went on to run Viacom, according to a person who attended the event.

Liquor flowed freely, with some bottles of wine costing more than $20,000, according to the people. The most expensive food item on the menu at the Prime Steakhouse, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, is a 28-ounce bone-in rib eye for $85.

To foot the bill, Mr. Smith dipped into his more than $1 million in winnings from gambling, especially at the blackjack table, during the week, the people said.

News of the meal, which was first reported by Bloomberg, surfaced after executives at MGM Resorts International mentioned the outsize dinner bill during a company conference call on Tuesday. They cited it in response to a question from an analyst about how spending at the casino now compares with levels before the recession. MGM did not identify Mr. Smith as the guest who had hosted the dinner.

James J. Murren, the chief executive of MGM, said he had not seen a check that size for several years.

“People are starting to spend money remarkably here,” Mr. Murren said.

The lavish dinner is the latest caper by Mr. Smith, who is charting a new course as a brash next-generation media mogul. He is known to drink with old-school media executives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the hipster enclave where Vice has its headquarters. He has called CNN an expletive and rented villas at Cannes during an annual international media conference there.

“They live larger, and that is part of the Vice je ne sais quoi,” said Michael E. Kassan, the chief executive of the media and marketing consulting firm MediaLink, who is known to throw his own prominent industry dinners. “But they do good stuff. I am a big fan. They represent so much of what is new and exciting in the world.”

Mr. Murren of MGM told the analyst Harry C. Curtis of Nomura Securities that he couldn’t believe it when he first saw the tab. He said, “$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That’s a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry.”"
652,"The Apple Watch might have been four years in the making and the most Jony Ive-centric Apple product yet — but the company didn’t get everything it was wishing for from the device.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations, only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project.

If Apple had had its way, the Apple Watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure, heart rate and even stress levels — but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry, the technology didn’t work quite as well as had been hoped.

Problems were apparently posed by Apple Watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin, with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn. Despite a heavy drain on Apple resources, engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device.

As a result, the Apple Watch shipping in April will be far more of an iPhone accessory/companion than had originally been planned, which is no doubt useful for growing Apple’s interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways. Although Apple has the luxury of taking its time with products, yesterday’s New Yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-Steve Jobs.

While there’s still a lot to be excited for, the health-tracking applications of the Apple Watch were ones that people are very excited about. Apple has already had success introducing HealthKit into top hospitals, and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between Apple and the healthcare industry.

In a recent interview, Steve Wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the Apple Watch. Cult of Mac has also written about the potential of the Apple Watch becoming your “digital doctor.”

Sadly, it seems we’re going to have to wait at least a couple of generations before the technology can live up to that billing."
653,"US officials say 11 commercial aircraft have gone missing from Tripoli International Airport in Libya – ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.

The airport was the scene of a fierce battle that ended on August 26, when fighters from the Islamic Fajr Libya (Dawn of Libya) coalition captured the airport and aircraft belonging to the state-owned Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.

Pictures from the airport in the aftermath of the fighting showed severely damaged and totally destroyed aircraft.

Dawn of Libya was identified as a terrorist organisation by the Libyan government earlier this year.

While the US State Department is down-playing the significance of the missing planes, one official was quoted in the Washington Free Beacon as saying: ‘There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.’

September 11 also marks the second anniversary of the raid of the US Ambassador’s compound in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans – including including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens – were killed.

Intelligence reports of the stolen aircraft include a warning that one or more of the planes could be used in terrorist attacks in the region. Another scenario involved using a plane with civilian markings to transport armed terrorists to an airport usually open to commercial aircraft.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade, and it plans to use them in terror attacks.

Tunisia and Egypt have stopped flights to and from Libya, and countries including Algeria, Morocco and Nigeria are on high alert.

655,"Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation, claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims.

It’s replacing the term with “first-year.”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Leigh-Anne Royster, the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix.

“Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,” she added.

In fact, the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix. “They were very adamant . . . and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.” 

Ironically, Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman.”

But no matter. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.

No public announcement was made about the word switch. According to the Fix, administrators relied “largely on word of mouth.”

657,"Update at 8:50 p.m. EDT

The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.

The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.

The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. This weekend, Haines' family had issued a public plea to his captors through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The family asked ISIS to make contact with them.

Haines, an international aid worker, was abducted in Syria in 2013. ""The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video Islamic State video identified him as a captive,"" the AP writes.

The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. At his posting there, Haines was ""working in the Atmeh refugee camp ... supplying water, food and tents.""

Over the past decade and a half he'd worked with a variety of aid agencies, writes the BBC: ""He had worked with a German charity on post-war reconstruction projects in Croatia, including housing and demining. He was also involved in efforts to help displaced people to return to their homes. In 2011 he became Head of Mission in Libya for Handicap International,"" an organization that works to help vulnerable people with disabilities.

""The following year he joined another agency, the Nonviolence Peaceforce (NP), and went to South Sudan,"" where he worked as an unarmed civilian peacekeeper.

ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. The second, which showed the beheading of Steven Sotloff and contained the threat directed towards Haines, was released on Sept. 2.

The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target.

NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The two previous videos began with footage of President Obama.

The man identified as Haines, Alice reports, is shown ""kneeling in a featureless desert in an orange robe.""

The video appears to be recent, Alice says: ""The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.""

Cameron has tweeted a response, writing, ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

President Obama said in a statement that the U.S. ""strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL,"" and pledged to work with the U.K. and other nations to ""bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice."""
658,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah man says he's fully recovered after he was hospitalized for chugging a quart of eggnog so quickly that he inhaled some of creamy holiday beverage into his lungs.

Ryan Roche from Utah County told KSL-TV (http://bit.ly/1rf4Eed ) that he participated in an alcohol-free eggnog chugging contest at a holiday office party earlier this month.

Roche says he downed a quart of eggnog in 12 seconds without taking a breath but soon began coughing and gasping.

Doctors told him he had eggnog in his lungs.

He was put on oxygen and antibiotics and released from the hospital after three days.

Roche says he recovered his strength after a week."

Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right. Either way we will be keeping our eyes and ears peeled for a possible invite, but in the meantime try not to get your hopes up just yet.

Ting Su, 29, caught husband Cheng naked in an underground carpark in China along with her twin sister after tracking the pair down using a mobile tracking system.

When Su arrived on the scene to confront them, the surprised pair reacted to the bust and jumped out of the car.

Su seized the moment by taking some happy snaps before driving off, leaving the cheaters red-faced in the carpark.

“It was so funny. Loads of people were grabbing their phones and I did as well. He was banging his fist on the window and shouting at her, and she just wasn’t playing ball,” one witness said.

663,"The man who jumped the White House fence Sept. 19 pushed his way past a female Secret Service agent before he was overpowered by a male agent in the building’s large East Room.

After he pushed past the female agent, he ran past the stairway that leads to the president’s personal quarters before he was detained.

The Secret Service’s response to Gonzalez’s dash from the front railing was slowed because perimeter alarms — dubbed “crash boxes” — had been muffled at the request of the White House’s ushers.

The man, Omar Gonzalez, is a former soldier, and was having delusions. The president was not at the White House when Gonzalez ran into the building.

The new revelation was published by the Washington Post and CBS.

The Post credited the new information to whistleblowers and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said the intrusion was a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the intrusion was “unacceptable” to her.

The report — likely leaked by Chaffetz — comes one day before Pierson testifies at his committee on Tuesday.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz told the Washington Post.

“It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

664,"Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden ""diagnostic port"" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with ""smart band"" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.

Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.

Update 2:13 PM: The diagnostic port will not be included on the Apple Watch that ships to consumers, according to 9to5Mac.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said on CNN Wednesday evening of the militants also known as ISIS. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

Johnson never mentioned Hunter by name, but he has called on lawmakers to act responsibly and not frighten Americans. “Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” Johnson said.

The group Judicial Watch reported late Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border within 36 hours. Hunter said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."""

""Everyone knows I'm pretty competitive,"" Ryan Roche of Lehi, Utah, told ABC News today, explaining how his colleagues talked him into participating just as he was leaving the party with his family earlier this month.

""I just decided I was going to win. So I pretty much just opened it up and poured it down my throat,"" he said.

Roche, 33, said he shaved 10 seconds off the previous best time of 22 seconds that day, earning him bragging rights and a $50 gift certificate to Ruth's Chris Steak House. But the glory was short-lived: Later, at home, he started to feel sick.

""Two hours later I was laying on the couch, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, having fevers and panting,"" said Roche, who works in sales.

His friend took him to the hospital while his wife stayed home with their three children.

In Roche's case, the eggnog may have literally gone down the wrong pipe, Dr. Robert Schilz of University Hospitals in Cleveland explained. The eggnog, which was booze-free, may have crept into Roche's windpipe, triggering pneumonia.

Roche spent a full day in the ICU and two more days recovering at the hospital.

""It was not fun,"" Roche said. ""It took me a full week of recovery to be 100 percent.""

Nearly two weeks later, he says the jokes won't stop at work.

669,"Dim Xiong Chien is a 22-year-old college student studying at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang in northeastern China.

According to reports, earlier this week Chien organized a surprise proposal with fireworks for his girlfriend Cong Yen, but she never showed up. So he decided to set them off anyway, hoping she’d see the huge display.

The whole plan literally went up in flames when the fireworks lit the grass on fire. Firefighters were called in to put out the 10-foot-tall flames.

The school is currently debating how to punish Chien, but they told local reporters that luckily they were insured. Chien eventually did propose to Yen, though this time without a pyrotechnics display.

The story was originally reported by state-run newspaper Shenyang Evening News and then made its way — unfortunately for Chien — to Chinese social media site Weibo.

“Of course, I love him,” Yen told local reporters. “But my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can’t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.”"
670,"The Lebanese army has detained a wife and a son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, as they crossed from Syria in recent days, security officials have said.

The military said that the wife was a Syian citizen and the detained son was nine years old.

According to the army statement, they were detained 10 days ago and have been questioned at the ministry of defence.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported the army detained her in coordination with ""foreign intelligence apparatus"". It said she had been travelling with a fake passport accompanied by one of her sons.

The armed ISIL group has seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon's neighbour to the east, declaring a ""caliphate"" over the territory it controls.

The Lebanese security forces have waged a crackdown on ISIL sympathisers in Lebanon and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the border crossings.

They have arrested over the past few months a number of ISIL fighters suspected of staging attacks to expand ISIL influence in Lebanon.

672,"Yesterday, Bleeding Cool had reported that one of the two batmobiles that are being used for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was stolen in Detroit. Well Zack Snyder solved the case himself over Twitter.

Snyder released this photo below, to make fun of that rumor and take a friendly shot at J.J. Abrams.

The caption to the photo read: “Case closed.”

These hilarious photos have been released throughout the shooting of both films (Batman v. Superman and Episode VII) by both directors, having a little fun with each other and using Twitter to do so.

Earlier this year, we have seen a couple of pics from Snyder, such as Henry Cavill as a Sith lord and Batman being followed by R2, in what looked to be Tatooine. J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot have fired back a friendly shot which included C3PO in Gotham with the Rebel Alliance symbol replacing the Bat symbol, which the caption read as “THE C3PED CRUSADER.”

Can we expect to see some friendly retaliation from J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot? I hope so! Keep an eye on both of the directors Twitter pages.

As for the rumor of the the stolen batmobile, the initial report by Bleeding Cool, has since been updated and debunked.

674,"A satirical website has poked fun at the Chinese practice of choosing alternative English names, in a report urging citizens to think carefully before making their decision.

The site, which is done in the style of the state-owned CCTV website, warns people against picking a name that could cause offence, or simply make no sense at all. Many Chinese people prefer to use an English name, particularly if they conduct business with the West. But the satirical site suggests people should avoid fictional characters, names with the potential for sexual innuendo, or random words like Dragon, Fish or Lawyer, which could come back and haunt you ""if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America"".

An English name should ""come with a 'feeling' or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from"", so names such as Satan or Dumbledore are out, the website says. Women are told to think carefully about ""food"" names such as Candy, Lolly or Sugar, which might be seen as ""stripper names"". There's also a lengthy warning about names with sexual connotations, especially when used in conjunction with Dong or Wang, which ""are used as slang for male genitalia... so avoid anything like 'Bunny Wang' at all times,"" the website says. Instead, a ""traditional"" name like Elizabeth, Catherine, William or George is considered a good choice. ""Pick one of these if you're looking for a 'safe' English name, often with implications of wealth,"" the website advises.

677,"Armed US drones, reportedly hunting for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, were spotted flying over Syrian airspace where the jihadists have stronghold, reports suggest.
Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa took photographs of remotely piloted planes flying over the area. Experts have identified the drones as 'US Predators', which were used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists, The Telegraph reports.
The United States has not made this military activity public but there is a widespread expectation that the Obama Administration will be stepping up its efforts to defeat the hardliner Sunni militant outfit, which has captured swathes of area in Iraq's north and in Syria over the past few months, declaring  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its 'Caliph'.
The reports of the unmanned drones being sent to target the self-proclaimed leader of the Sunni extremist organisation, is a clear indication that the US will not back down in their mission to annihilate the terrorist group that has proved to be the greatest threat to Washington in recent times, which according to Pentagon, even surpasses that once posed by al-Qaeda.
Even as President Obama has succeeded in assembling nine NATO nations that are willing to join the US in crushing the militant group, diplomatic efforts to win support were further bolstered on Monday when Iraq's parliament voted to approve a new government under Haider Al-Abadi's leadership. The new government is expected to cooperate fully with the US in its ambition to defeat the insurgents.
The United States is particularly hopeful of better days ahead as Abadi, who is a member of Iraq's Shiite majority had earlier promised to include Sunnis and Kurds in his government. The US is convinced that ISIS's prominence and growth might somehow be checked if the country heals itself of the massive sectarian divide that it is suffering from.
The increased measure to check the militants' influence comes as the new head of the UN human rights office in Geneva, said the world's foremost human rights priority needs to be ending the deadly conflicts in Iraq and Syria.?

An Islamic State message published by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity, said the American woman, Kayla Mueller, was killed when the building where she was being held in the Raqqa area collapsed in an airstrike.

“The failed Jordanian aircraft killed an American female hostage,” said the message. “No mujahid was injured in the bombardment, and all praise is due to Allah.” Mujahid means fighter.

The group said the woman was killed by “fire of the shells dropped on the site.”

There was no immediate way to verify the claim by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But it identified the hostage by name for the first time, and gave her address in Prescott, Ariz., apparently to add credibility to its message. The group also posted photographs of an obliterated house where, it said, Ms. Mueller's body had been buried beneath the rubble.

The White House said American intelligence officials were investigating the claim.

“We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,” said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim.”

Jordanian officials cast doubt on the Islamic State's claim but did not explicitly rule it out. Jordan's foreign minister, Nasser S. Judeh, said on his Twitter account that the claim was “An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.”

The Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq, has executed three other American hostages, all men, in beheadings that it posted on the Internet. An American-led coalition that includes Jordan and other Arab allies of the United States has been bombing Islamic State targets on a frequent basis for months.

Ms. Mueller, 26, the only known remaining American hostage held by the Islamic State, is a humanitarian aid worker who disappeared in August 2013 after she had driven into the northern Syria city of Aleppo with her Syrian boyfriend. Her colleagues received a proof-of-life video a few months later, showing her wearing a hijab and begging for her life.

Her family had asked news organizations to avoid identifying her by name while she was still in captivity. But the Islamic State's use of her name in its message on Friday changed their thinking, even though there was no proof she had been killed.

In a statement about Ms. Mueller, the family called her a passionate aid worker who had been taken captive by the Islamic State after she had left an Aleppo hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity.

“The common threat of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,"" the statement said.

Ms. Mueller, the statement said, had “devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world.”

The immolation death of the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, 26, which was posted on the Internet in a carefully produced Islamic State video on Tuesday, generated new levels of world outrage. It was never made clear when the pilot, who was captured in late December, had been killed.

Jordan hung two convicted terrorist prisoners, including a woman, in retaliation on Wednesday and launched bombing attacks on Islamic State targets in neighboring Syria as a further response for vengeance.

A senior United States military official with knowledge of the targets attacked by the Jordanians said the targets in and around Raqqa that were struck were carefully vetted and scrutinized, as with previous strikes, and there were no indications in advance that any hostages were located at the facilities.

“The same high standards we apply to all targets in the vetting stage were applied to these,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. “If there’s any inkling a person like that was there, we don’t go there.”

The official cautioned that without proof of the American hostage’s death, the statement by the Islamic State could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes.

The official said though the Jordanian fighter jets took the lead in the strike in and around Raqqa, they were accompanied by American aircraft, as is standard on bombing runs over territory held by the Islamic State in Syria."

683,"A US journalist held by al-Qaeda in Yemen was killed by militants during an operation to rescue him, US and Yemeni officials say.

Luke Somers was shot by his captors during a raid by US forces, a US official told the New York Times.

His sister, Lucy Somers, told the Associated Press that she had been notified by the FBI of his death.

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel confirmed the killing and said a second, non-US hostage, also died.

Yemen's defence ministry confirmed a ""major operation"" had taken place in Yemen's southern Shabwa province on Saturday.

Mr Somers, who was kidnapped in Yemen in 2013, had appeared in a video appealing for help.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" Lucy Somers told AP, speaking from London.

A drone strike believed to have been carried out by the US is reported to have killed nine suspected al-Qaeda militants in the region.

Mr Somers, 33, worked as a journalist and photographer for local news organisations. His material appeared on international news outlets, including the BBC News website.

He was kidnapped outside a supermarket in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 and is believed to have been sold on to al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP).

The video of him released this week showed a member of AQAP threatening to kill Mr Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

The Pentagon confirmed that an an attempt to rescue Mr Somers last month had failed.

His family appealed in a video to al-Qaeda militants in Yemen to ""show mercy"" and release him.

""Luke is only a photojournalist and is not responsible for any actions the US government has taken,"" his brother, Jordan, said in a video.

AQAP is regarded by the US as one of the deadliest offshoots of al-Qaeda.

As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

687,"Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

688,"The Islamic State terror group has burned the corpses of five of its fighters due to the belief that they had contracted the deadly Ebola virus, according to an Iraqi health official who told Kurdish paper Rudaw.

“The Islamic State organization incinerated five militants infected with Ebola to prevent further spread of the disease in Mosul (Iraq),” said Faisal Ghazi, who is part of Iraq’s Health Committee in its council of ministries. He added, “ISIS had proof that these militants were infected with Ebola.”

On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News reported that multiple Iraqi and Kurdish news outlets had claimed that Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq had contracted the deadly virus. Iraqi news outlets claimed at the time that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital.

A World Health Organization (WHO) official told Mashable at the time, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.

Kurdish news site Xendan elaborated further, reporting that the ISIS fighters’ symptoms were similar to those who had contracted Ebola. An Iraqi paper claimed that the virus had made its way into Mosul through jihadists who were recruited out of Africa.

However, most of the Islamic State’s Africa-based recruits have come from countries where Ebola has not had a documented presence. It also remains unclear whether Mosul health officials would even have the means, training or education necessary to test for Ebola. Furthermore, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ahmed Rudaini, told Al-Maalomah News that Mosul simply doesn’t have the technology available to confirm an Ebola case."
689,"(CNN) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea's erratic young leader, Kim Jong Un, only deepens by the day.

He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates.

The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position.

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions.

""Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,"" Cha says. ""I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line.""

Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea?

Who is Kim Yo Jong?

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names.

Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well.

Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts ""almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,"" Madden says.

He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Ready for prime time?

Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming.

""If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,"" Cha says. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow.

If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully.

690,"Apple’s next-generation MacBook Air, which is expected to come with a 12-inch screen, will have a “radically new design” that will abandon traditional specifications to produce a noticeably thinner and lighter device compared to the current 11-inch model, according to a report.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing “sources within Apple” with access to “internal prototype versions” of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan’s DigiTimes in December, Apple’s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production."
691,"Update: The original source of the story, Bloomberg now adds that the face of Michelle Obama was not blurred by the State TV. It quotes several journalists from within Saudi Arabia covering the event, adding that the State TV in fact did not blur the face of the First Lady anyway.

According to Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the blurring isn’t real.

“Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.”

CNN correspondent Hala Gorani also tweeted out that the Saudi TV in fact did not blur Michelle Obama’s face.

Our Nic Robertson in Riyadh telling me footage he saw on Saudi TV did not show a blurred Michelle Obama. On that note, Good night Twitter!

— Hala Gorani (@HalaGorani) January 27, 2015

Original Story:

U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might have found it apt to cut short their trip to India to pay homage to former Saudi King Abdullah, who passed away last week. The Saudis, however, don’t seem to be enamored by the presence of the First Lady in their country.

According to a report by Bloomberg, the Saudi state television allegedly blurred out the face of Michelle Obama during a brief televised meeting between the new Saudi King Salman and the President at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. In fact, the new King reportedly refused to acknowledge the presence of the First Lady and did not say hello or shake hands with her, the report adds. Other media houses from the Middle East, however, showed the unedited footage of the meeting without obscuring the face of Michelle Obama.

Hours after the state TV ran those clips, several of them were posted to Facebook, reports the Washington Times. However, most of the videos were subsequently taken down — probably at the behest of Saudi’s Internet Police. A version of the clip is now up on YouTube. We are unsure, however, how long it would remain there. We have managed to capture a screenshot of the video, just in case. The video is embedded below.

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama also faced criticism from some Arab media outlets for her decision to wear blue on her visit. They added that the First Lady should have worn a black dress, which is more appropriate for a funeral. Also pertinent to note was the fact that Michelle Obama did not wear a head scarf during the time she was out in public. As per Saudi law, all women in the country, even visitors, are required by law to wear a head scarf while in public. This is perhaps why the state TV blurred the First Lady out entirely.

There is also talk about the new Saudi King insulting Barack Obama by breaking protocol. The new King apparently abruptly turned around and walked away from the President in order to go for a prayer. This, however, could have been due to the inexperience of the new King, others allege.

Later in the day, the Saudi King held bilateral talks with other senior staff, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal, and CIA director John Brennan. A statement by the White House later announced the following.

“Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

The alleged decision by the Saudi state television to blur the face of Michelle Obama once again raises the question of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia. The country has strict laws that restrict freedom of movement of women. In fact, it was only recently that the country gave womenfolk the right to vote. It is also the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. Now, with even the wife of the world’s most powerful man being targeted, albeit indirectly, the world is certain to take note.

698,"Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.

The ad-supported option — part of an overhaul of its media offerings — poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.

“If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. “It won’t be $99 a year.”

Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix’s current monthly price of $7.99.

“Who wouldn’t switch if you were poor or you’re a cord-cutter?” he added.

Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon’s plans.

“The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn’t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,” the source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it’s a definite go.

Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn’t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.

While Prime’s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.

A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides — but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon’s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including “The Wire,” “True Blood” and “Boardwalk Empire.” Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.

Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.

For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.

The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.

Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

Amazon didn’t return a call seeking comment."

Also, a cure for AIDS, probably, but also the Led Zeppelin thing. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones agreed to a “35 dates in three cities” tour, but Robert Plant was having none of it, and like a poorly written character in an Aaron Sorkin script, he literally ripped up a contract.

[Plant] and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.

Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.

“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.” (Via)

701,"There can only be Un.

Shortly before North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un came to power, a directive was issued to force anyone sharing his name to change it, according to an internal document obtained by South Korean TV station KBS, The Guardian reported Wednesday.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” the document reads.

The order was issued in January 2011 after the death of Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il. The process requires changing names on official documents, such as government ID cards and school diplomas, and keeps in line with a tradition upheld by the Kim dynasty, The Guardian reports.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip… regarding this project,” the directive added.

The authenticity of the document cannot be independently verified and South Korea has refused to comment on it.

702,"Mexico's attorney general says DNA tests have shown that 28 bodies found in a mass grave are not those of a missing group of students.

Jesus Murillo Karam said further tests were being carried out on four other recently discovered grave sites.

The 43 students went missing three weeks ago amid violent protests in Iguala, south of Mexico City.

Mr Karam said 14 more police officers had been arrested, accused of handing the students over to a drugs gang.

About 50 people have been arrested in connection with the students' disappearance, with the vast majority being local police officers.

The officers are believed to have been working for a drugs gang, known as the Guerreros Unidos.

On Tuesday, police said the gang's leader, Benjamin Mondragon, had killed himself when he was about to be arrested during an operation by Mexican security forces in the state of Morelos.

The missing students all attended a teacher training college in Iguala, some 200km (125 miles) south of Mexico City.

The college has a history of left-wing activism but it is not clear whether the students were targeted for their political beliefs.

Renewed hope

They disappeared after deadly clashes with the police on 26 September in which six people died. Eyewitnesses reported seeing them being bundled into police vans.

Will Grant, the BBC's Mexico correspondent, says confirmation the missing students were not found in mass graves will give their families renewed hope.

Many of the families are camped out in Iguala waiting for answers from the local authorities.

On Monday, crowds of fellow students and teachers from the teaching college set fire to Guerrero state headquarters in the city of Chilpancingo.

They are angry at a perceived lack of progress in the investigation and have called for state governor Angel Aguirre to resign.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has vowed to find and punish those responsible for the disappearances, saying the incident was ""shocking, painful and unacceptable""."
703,"Iraq’s Interior Ministry said on Wednesday that a woman detained by Lebanese authorities was not the wife of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but the sister of a man convicted of bombings in southern Iraq.

“The one detained by Lebanese authorities was Saja Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi who is detained by authorities and sentenced to death for his participation in ... explosions,” ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan told Reuters.

“The wives of the terrorist al-Baghdadi are Asmaa Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Esraa Rajab Mahel al-Qaisi, and there is no wife in the name of Saja al-Dulaimi,” he said.

Maan said Saja Dulaimi had fled to Syria where she was detainees by authorities. She was part of a group of female detainees freed in exchange for the release of a group of nuns captured by Islamist rebels in Syria, he said.

Security officials in Lebanon said on Tuesday the Lebanese army had detained a wife and daughter of Baghdadi’s as they crossed from Syria late last month.

They were detained in northern Lebanon after the woman was found with a fake passport, officials said. Investigators were questioning her at the Lebanese Defense Ministry."
704,"With Christian Bale already secured to play the lead in Aaron Sorkin's highly anticipated Steve Jobs biopic, Seth Rogen's has now been added to the list of potential cast-members.

The 32-year-old actor is reportedly talks to portray Steve Wozniak - who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the 1970s - according to The Wrap.

Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain - who is currently starring alongside Matthew McConaughey in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar - is also being courted for a role in the film, simply entitled Jobs.

Return of the Mac: Seth Rogen, left, is reportedly in talks to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, right, in the upcoming Steve Jobs biography, Jobs

Slumdog Millionaire film-maker Danny Boyle is to direct from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who used Steve Jobs' authorised biography by Walter Isaacson.

The film - which will reportedly not be a traditional biopic - is expected to follow the late technology whiz during three stressful and high profile product launches throughout Apple's history.

While talking with Bloomberg on Thursday, 53-year-old Aaron Sorkin revealed that British actor Christian Bale would be playing the title role in Jobs.

A new Jobs: Christian Bale has been cast as the lead in Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic

Based on the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, Jobs will feature Bale, 40, in every frame of the film.

But that daunting acting task doesn’t worry Sorkin, who cast Bale without even an audition and called the Dark Knight trilogy star a ‘phenomenal actor’ during the interview.

If this all seems familiar, that is because another biographical film – with the same name – about Steve Jobs came out in August 2013 to a great deal of fanfare.

Another Steve: Ashton Kutcher played Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the 2013 film co-starring Josh Gad

Starring Ashton Kutcher, 36, as Jobs, that movie chronicled the Apple co-founder’s career from college in the 1970s through the introduction of the iPod in 2001.

Christian’s version, in contrast, will focus mostly on three major speeches Steve Jobs gave during his career.

‘What we needed was the best actor,’ Sorkin said of Bale, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2010’s The Fighter (filmed between instalments of Bale’s Batman movies).

Winner: Despite years of critically acclaimed roles, Bale won his first Academy Award for The Fighter in 2011

Christian was again nominated for an Oscar for 2013’s American Hustle and has been a critically acclaimed actor since starring in Steven Spielberg’s Empire Of The Sun at 14.

Despite being best known as a superhero, Bale is known for physically transforming himself thoroughly between roles and thus should be fine to take on the more cerebral Jobs role.

Before his death in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, Jobs gained a reputation as an excellent speaker, in addition to his work in creating and then transforming Apple Computers.

It’s a big leap from Batman to Jobs, but if there’s one actor who can play both muscle-bound Bruce Wayne and skinny Steve Jobs, it is Christian Bale.

706,"Arrived in the convent of Macerata in June last year, the religious is of South American origin. But the abbess denied: ""No sister gave birth to a child.""

A young cloistered nun, of Bolivian origin and 35 years, gave birth to a baby at the hospital Bartolomeo Eustachio San Severino Marche (Macerata). When she arrived at the hospital, brought by the sisters worried about his health, complained a strong stomach ache. Performed the ultrasound, the truth was immediately clear and the nun, Sunday, was transferred in obstetrics, where a few hours after she gave birth to a child. Great secrecy is maintained on each other. The nun would however confided to doctors the decision to hold the child and will probably entrusted to a host community. For the moment, the baby was conducted to investigations in Neonatology Hospital of Macerata. It would be in good health, but being born after a pregnancy held without health checks, it is preferred to subject it to more accurate analyzes. No comment for now by the bishop of Camerino Francesco Brugnaro.

In San Severino cloistered convents are two, Santa Rita and Santa Caterina, but in the area there are many other religious structures. The Mother Abbess of the monastery of St. Clare of San Severino explained that the nun who gave birth is not ""cloistered"" in one of the convents of the area. ""The story - he said - not about any Poor Clare Sister of our community, nor sisters of monasteries in the area."" ""Let me say this - he added - categorically to dispel any doubt and refute inaccurate information circulating at the moment and that led many journalists to contact our address."" Sister Rosella takes to defend ""the meaning of our life choice,"" and ensure that ""no cloistered nun of eight monasteries of the Diocese of Camerino-San Severino gave birth to a son.""

VERSION OF THE CONVENT - From the convent of the Missionary Sisters of the Love of the Heart of Christ of San Severino Marche ensure that the young woman who has given birth ""is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping."" But certainly we know that is from Bolivia and her age. Several sources ensure that this is just a religious, but the sisters did not want to add anything else, without explaining even if the woman has or has not taken vows.

707,"A female worker reportedly gives out fake ratings to apps by physically going handset to handset. (Internet photo)

A photo recently uploaded online in China showing someone reportedly working on an array of mobile phones has gone viral overnight, as it gives a glimpse into China's app-ranking manipulation factory, reports Tencent Technology.

In the photo posted on to China's Weibo microblog, a woman with about a hundred iPhones placed before her appears to be giving out fake ratings to apps by going phone by phone.

About a hundred fake ratings, which have the potential to affect the top lists of Apple's App Store, can be created within an hour or two.

Apple has had adopted a number of measures to crackdown on fake downloads and cheating the rankings, including lowering the price of apps to only 1 yuan (US$0.16) which the company hopes could draw more real users to rate.

Yet given the fact that people in China are physically simulating real users, as seen in the leaked photo, it would be tough to crack down on the industry.

Numbers are important, as a majority of users refer to ratings when it comes to downloading apps. Those with better ratings have a much higher chance of being downloaded."

709,"A hoax story about street artist Banksy being arrested in Watford has duped internet users.

US website National Report alleged the Metropolitan Police had held the elusive graffiti artist after he was traced by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force"".

It claimed his art studio in the capital had been raided and “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” found.

The story also said documents identified the anonymous artist as 35-year-old Paul Homer, from Liverpool.

He was said to be in custody “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

However, Scotland Yard confirmed the story - which left Banksy's name trending on Twitter - was fake.

A spokesman said: ""We are certainly not aware of Banksy being arrested in Watford, or anywhere else for that matter.""

The story hit a chord with Louise Mensch, the former Conservative MP who is active on Twitter.

She fell for the scam and criticised the Metropolitan Police for not focusing on the ""so many other criminals out there"".

But she quickly apologised when she was alerted to the story being a prank.

The story fooled thousands of others on social media, who expressed shock that the infamous artist had been unmasked at last.

However, there were several clear discrepancies in the National Report story.

The report quotes ""London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards"", which is a fictional name, and uses a picture of an arrest ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival in 2011."

Seth Rogen is being eyed to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled film, based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin, which is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years.

Negotiations have not yet begun, and it’s not even clear if Rogen has an official offer, but the producers — Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon — have set their sights on the talent and are in talks.

Of course, this may all be for naught as Christian Bale, the actor who is to play Jobs, is still in the midst of closing his deal. Sources say that dealmaking process is in a sensitive stage.

Insiders say Boyle will is flying to Los Angeles to meet with actress to play one of the female leads, an assistant to Jobs. Insiders say that Jessica Chastain is one of the actresses on the meeting list.

714,"Canadian national and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Gill Rosenberg, 31, revealed to the Israeli media earlier this month that she had traveled to Iraq to help the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fight off ISIS.
""They are our brothers,"" she told Israel Radio of the Kurds. ""They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.""
Now, just three weeks later, there are rumors she may be in ISIS custody. Posts on ISIS-affiliated web forums, including Al Platform Media, claim the ""Zionist soldier"" was captured while fighting with the Kurds against ISIS in Kobane, a small majority-Kurdish town along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
There has indeed been intense fighting in Kobane between ISIS and the YPG over the past 24 hours. However, YPG sources have strongly denied to the Journal and other outlets that Rosenberg was captured.
So far, neither group has provided evidence either way, and ISIS has yet to release an official statement.

A spokesperson at the IDF news desk told the Journal that the IDF is not keeping track of Rosenberg, and ""does not have a way of knowing"" if she's been captured by ISIS. Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon, too, told Channel 2 that he had no information on Rosenberg's whereabouts.
Rosenberg, formerly a resident of Tel Aviv, did post to Facebook on Nov. 20 that she would be taking a short leave from social media.
""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"" she wrote. ""Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""
A couple weeks before that, right around her 31st birthday, Rosenberg posted photos of herself on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and wrote: ""In the IDF, we say אחריי - After Me. Let's show ISIS what that means.""
 

 

 
A friend of hers from the IDF told the Journal that he remembered Rosenberg as ""a cute lady with a strong ideology."" On Twitter, her tagline is: ""On a spiritual journey and a quest for authenticity.""
Her attraction to foreign battlgrounds aside, the IDF-turned-YPG warrior has a pretty bizarre backstory. She reportedly served a few years in U.S. prison for a phone scam that she ran out of Israel, in which elderly Americans were ""bilked out of millions of dollars, collectively,"" according to the FBI.
Since news of her possible capture broke, friends and supporters have filled her Facebook wall with respects, prayers and side-by-side photos of the Israeli and Kurdish flags.

ISIS members writing on the Al Platform Media forum urged leaders to use Rosenberg as a bargaining chip for a prisoner exchange with Israel.
In a phone interview with the Journal, Emmanuel Nachshon, spokesman for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, distanced the government from Rosenberg. ""She’s her own person,"" he said. ""As an individual, she’s free to do whatever she wants. We're not in a position to tell her what to do. ... Remember, she didn’t go there as an Israeli. She never said, 'I’m representing Israel.'""
Nachshon said the foreign ministry was aware Rosenberg was fighting for the Kurds, but has not been able to confirm the kidnapping rumors. ""Our researchers are looking into it,"" he said. (CBC News in Canada reports that the Canadian foreign ministry is likewise ""pursuing all appropriate channels"" to locate Rosenberg.)
Asked if Israel was expecting ISIS to try and negotiate, Nachshon said: ""I hear they are more in the business of cutting heads.""

715,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Nicaragua's government said Sunday that a mysterious boom heard overnight in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua's airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 12 meters (39 feet) and a depth of 5 meters (16 feet), said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The development calls into question the narrative originally released by the Secret Service, which had suggested that Omar Gonzalez, 42, of Texas, had been taken into custody near the front doors of the White House after jumping the fence and running more the 100 yards into the national landmark.

Obama 'Obviously Concerned' Over Security Breach

“Gonzalez failed to comply with responding Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers’ verbal commands, and was physically apprehended after entering the White House North Portico doors,” the Secret Service said in a statement on Sept. 20.

When he jumped over the fence outside of the White House, Gonzalez was allegedly carrying a folding pocket knife. After pushing through the front doors, he ran to the East Room, according to the official, confirming details first reported by The Washington Post.

A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment, but the agency’s director, Julie Pierson, will be on the hot seat Tuesday as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing to examine several issues dogging the Secret Service.

In an interview with ABC News, the chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Gonzalez got deep enough into the White House that had President Obama or Vice President Joe Biden been there “they could have been attacked.”

Signs of increased security around the White House were almost immediate after Gonzales made it into the complex, including additional barriers outside of the White House gates. In addition, the Secret Service beefed-up foot patrols along the fence line of the White House complex and deployed additional surveillance resources, a White House spokesman said at the time.

Gonzalez had been homeless in the nation’s capital for the past three months after 13 years in the U.S. Army, including a tour in Iraq."
718,"Amazon is going to open a brick-and-mortar store in New York City in time for holiday shopping, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Journal's sources say the store will be located in Manhattan on 34th Street, across from the Empire State Building, and will give Amazon a way to connect with customers in the physical world.

The store would reportedly function like a mini-warehouse, with inventory for same-day delivery in New York City, and would also act as a hub for product returns, exchanges, and pickup of online orders. Sources also said that Amazon might use the space to showcase products like its new Kindle tablets, its Fire smartphone, and its TV box, Fire TV.

People familiar with the plans told The Wall Street Journal that nothing was set in stone yet, and the company may decide to ditch the idea. However, if Amazon does open the store and has a successful launch, it may open more brick-and-mortar locations in other US cities.

Amazon has experimented with pop-up shops in the past — last year, it put Kindle vending machines in malls across the country — but this would be its biggest, riskiest attempt. As The Journal points out, opening up physical locations wouldn't be cheap: Leases, new employees, and managing inventory would all cut into the company's already thin profit margins.

Amazon's potential location would be 7 West 34th Street, an area that sees a lot of foot-traffic because of its proximity to the Empire State Building and ample shopping.

719,"In North Korea, no one can have the same name as supreme leader Kim Jong Un.

According to reports, North Korea previously banned anyone from sharing the name Jong Un. Newborns cannot be given the name, and citizens who bore it before the ban were required to assume new names.

South Korean media outlets including KBS and Yonhap News Agency said the name ban was contained in a directive from 2011 which was issued months before Kim Jong Un came to power and was only recently leaked outside North Korea.

The leaked document said that “all party organs and public security authorities” should identify residents who shared the supreme leader's name and ""train them to voluntarily change [it],” per The Guardian.

People named Jong Un -- said to be a common Korean name for both men and women -- apparently were directed to change their names on official documents such as birth certificates, social security cards and school diplomas.

According to the BBC, it was likely that there was “little forewarning” of the name ban, since Kim Jong Un -- the youngest son of predecessor Kim Jong Il -- had been relatively unknown to the general public prior to his ascension to head of state.

A South Korean government official this week confirmed the authenticity of the directive, reports The New York Times.

“It’s true that in North Korea, they now allow only one [Jong Un],” the official, who was unnamed, told the paper.

According to Yonhap News Agency, the Pyongyang regime issued a similar name ban when Kim Jong Il was in power and when his father, North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung, was as well."

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August.

The fighters withdrew after a truce negotiated by clerics, but took 30 hostages, three of whom have been executed."
721,"On Monday’s edition of CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon released audio allegedly recorded in the Canfield apartment complex at the exact time of Michael Brown’s death on Aug. 9. The audio features a man speaking via video chat about unrelated topics (“You are pretty,” he says at one point). The recording is regarded as such an important piece of evidence, however, because one can clearly hear at least 10 gunshots ring out over the course of the 12-second file — first a group of six shots, then four more.

The man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, appeared on CNN to discuss the tape: “I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.” She has since reached out to the FBI, which has sent representatives to meet with Blumenthal and her client. “They thought this would be an important part of the investigation,” she said.

“At the time, he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing,” Blumenthal said.

CNN reports on what the new evidence could indicate:
Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.’”

Lemon cautioned: “CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of this tape and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording."
722,"When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.

Today, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.

However, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.

Another report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.

That said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.

The main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…"

The company did not immediately confirm or deny the existence of the product, leaving the Internet in a tizzy.

The plot thickened this morning, when Durex initially tweeted a denial but then deleted it, leading to further confusion. Finally, though, Durex put the rumors to rest: an unnamed company spokesperson told BuzzFeed that Durex would not be coming out with a pumpkin spice condom.

“Durex has heard that people are saying we launched a ‘Pumpkin Spice’ condom,"" the spokesperson said. ""We can’t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.""

725,"A Judd Nelson death hoax struck on Sunday as a FOX News impostor website posted a false report stating that the “Brat Pack” actor was found dead in his condo. It was all a hoax. Judd Nelson is not dead. The fake news site even created an elaborate story surrounding Judd Nelson’s alleged death, writing that the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner was trying to determine his cause of death as investigators attempted to rule out foul play. In a report called “BREAKING: “Brat Pack” Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo,” the hoaxer wrote the following untrue tale of Nelson’s demise.

“Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m. Although police have not yet released the man’s identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson’s condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.”

Judd Nelson doesn’t even live in a Los Angeles condo located in a 31-story West Hollywood high-rise building. That little detail was fabricated along with the news of his death.

The actor’s agent and his manager both confirmed that the news of his death was premature. Agent Gregg Klein even visited Nelson to snap a photo of the 55-year-old actor, producer and screenwriter clutching a copy of today’s newspaper in his hands, according to Los Angeles Times. As visible in the photo at the top of the page, the actor is still alive. Klein forwarded a copy of the pic to Los Angeles Times along with a message that was short and to the point.

“Reports of Judd Nelson’s death are not accurate please see attached photo.”

Nelson’s manager, Jean-Pierre Henraux, also confirmed that the actor was a victim of a death hoax, calling his condition “perfect” and noting that he recently filmed an episode of the upcoming television series Empire, a family drama set in a hip-hop empire. The show’s stars include Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson, Jim Cantafio and Jackie Dallas.

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, a cruel death hoax involving Zayn Malik made headlines when it was incorrectly reported that his younger cousin had died. Little Arshiya Malik underwent surgery for a brain tumor, and someone on Twitter started #RIP Arshiya, which quickly began trending worldwide. Arshiya is not dead. However, she is very ill, and her family is praying for her recovery.

A group called Free James Foley had been dedicated to finding and saving Foley since his disappearance. The search met its devastating end on Tuesday when the Iraqi group issued video proof of his murder, and threatened more to come: The Daily Beast reports that Time journalist Steven Sotloff is also shown in the video, and that ISIS threatens he will be next if the U.S. doesn’t cease and desist its operations in Iraq.

727,"The TV streaming services market may be on the verge of the biggest change yet given reports HBO and Apple may be talking about an exclusive partnership that would leave Netflix, Amazon and every other market player scrambling to make similar moves to grow subscription base and push TV boxes and sticks into consumer hands.

The news comes as HBO puts the finishing touches on its impending HBO Now standalone streaming service, built and designed by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is scheduled to debut by April 12.

Currently HBO subscribers typically pay for the channel's programming and service through a cable, telecomm or satellite provider, paying either a set standalone monthly fee or as part of a content bundle package.

With HBO Now, however, consumers will be able to subscribe directly from HBO for a $15 monthly fee. Reports say Time Warner, which owns HBO, is aiming to build a network of distributors to push the HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service, and the 70 million cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers.

Pulling Apple TV on as a partner would be a huge win-win given Apple's computing ecosystem and the access to Apple smartphone consumers.

For Apple, landing HBO Now for its fledgling Apple TV would be a major coup and compliment HBO Go, a mobile streaming service, already available via Apple TV since 2013.

HBO's subscriber price for HBO Now, however, may prove a sticky point as entrenched competitor Netflix has kept its prices at nearly half that cost. There's also the potential of exhausting consumers with fees given they're already laying out money for the Web TV boxes and sticks. While these costs are typically much less than a cable subscription the increasing number of standalone services could prove to be confusing and ultimately more expensive at some point.

It's clear, however, that HBO believes the HBO Now cost is appropriate and isn't about the change the reported pricing of $15 a month.

""It's a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,"" HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during an earnings call last month.

Obviously some Time Warner shareholders like the idea of HBO and Apple partnering as shares rallied end of day Wednesday on the reports though ultimately ended flat.

At this point HBO is not providing details regarding the Apple partnership report, and Apple has declined to comment.

 ""We know there's great anticipation around our standalone streaming service,"" an HBO spokesman said in a statement. ""And when we have details to share, we will do so.""

Another compelling aspect for Apple striving to be the sole HBO Now partner is the fact that HBO produces ""Games of Thrones,"" one of the most popular streaming content programs to date. The arrival of HBO Now is expected to debut with the fifth season's premiere.

Yet streaming content competitors' programs have been pulling in strong viewer support as well. Netflix's ""House of Cards"" series is extremely popular and Amazon's original content program, ""Transparent,"" has won an Emmy award."

Christian Bale will not be Steve Jobs after all.

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actor has fallen off the Jobs biopic that is being directed by Danny Boyle.

The Sony project, which has a script by Aaron Sorkin and is being produced by Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon, was on track to begin shooting this winter for a quick turnaround.

Boyle is due in town this week to meet with actors and actresses for the movie. Seth Rogen is in discussions to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, but no official offer has been made. It is unclear how Bale’s departure will affect casting.

Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw. The script is said to be divided into three acts that detail Jobs preparing for three presentations that came to define his life and the life of the company he co-founded, lost and came back to.

On Oct. 23, Sorkin told Bloomberg TV that Bale was playing Jobs. ""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale,"" the writer said at the time. ""He didn’t have to audition. Well, there was a meeting.""

Bale marks the second high-profile actor to receive an offer from Sony for the Jobs role but eventually pass. Leonardo DiCaprio also was in line for the late tech icon before moving on to shoot The Revenant. Neither had begun negotiations.

730,"Glenn Beck on Wednesday expressed fear that the 11 jets reportedly seized by radical Islamist groups in Libya over the past month could be used to cause extraordinary damage to the United States, even if the jets never leave the Middle East.

How? Extremists could crash the planes into the oil fields in any of the oil-rich countries on which the U.S. is dependent.
Beck was speaking with Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) about the jets when Bachmann remarked: “There’s really two concerns. One, the planes could be used in a similar way that they were used on 9/11 in the United States. They could be used as, essentially, flying bombs — into oil fields, buildings or strategic targets. Number two, [a] plane could be loaded with terrorists, could land as a commercial aircraft in an American city somewhere, or a European city. [They could] deplane, go about, carry out maybe a Mumbai-type disaster. So there’s multiple ways these planes could be used.”

“Oil fields,” Beck repeated. “The thing you said that feels the most true to me is the oil fields. … We’ll know what airplane — that’s one of those missing airplanes — but you could take off in Libya and be over the skies of Saudi Arabia in lightning speed, and just crash it.”

Bachmann said that with some routes, if a flight to Saudi Arabia deviates from its course, the Saudis only have 90 seconds to neutralize the threat before it could cause tremendous harm.

“It’s very little time that they have,” she said.

732,"A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious edict forbidding the building of snowmen, describingt them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country’s north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: “It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

“They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick. “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,” he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: “A people looking for a fatwa [religious ruling] for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa.”

Munajjid had some supporters however. “It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,” one wrote. “May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about.”

734,"Robert Plant didn’t have a whole lotta love for this deal.
He and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.
Founding members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones signed on immediately when the flamboyant investor offered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the staggering amount to perform just 35 tour dates in three locations including London, Berlin and New Jersey, according to the UK’s Mirror.
But Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.
“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.”
Guitarist Page and bassist Jones were all set to perform along with drummer Jason Bonham, who has filled in for his late father, John Bonham, in the past.
They gave their cranky frontman two days to think about the historic reunion, and he turned into a real heartbreaker for fans who have dreamed of another reunion tour.
“It was a no-brainer for them, but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” the source said. “They have tried to talk him ’round, but there is no chance. His mind is made up and that’s that.”
And it’s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant’s unique voice.
“There is no way they can go ahead without him,” the source said.
Branson, a tremendous fan of the ’70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the “The Song Remains the Same” rockers back on stage together.
The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets “The Starship” and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.
He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band’s landmark hit.
“Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer’s diss.
The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London’s O2 arena in 2007.
The band has been notoriously cranky about whether it would ever reunite, with Plant even calling one reporter a “schmuck” during a press conference in 2012."
737,"Amazon.com announced plans for its first brick-and-mortar store, Dow Jones reported. It will open on 34th Street in Manhattan across the street from the Empire State Building, just in time for this year's holiday season.

The experimental pop-up store will function as a small warehouse, holding limited inventory for same-day deliveries only in New York. The store may also host tech showcases for items such as Kindle e-readers, Fire phones and Fire TVs.

A customer may order an item online and then pick it up that same day in the store.

Amazon stock was down 2 percent in midafternoon trading Thursday.

The company risks increasing costs related to retailing such as paying leases and hiring workers. But if the store is successful, it may set a precedent for additional stores in other cities.

Amazon has been researching and scouting a possible store for several years, said a person familiar with the project. Two years ago, the company went as far as scouting spots in Seattle, where it is headquartered.

""Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in-store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that,"" Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst, told Dow Jones.

Other companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have already incorporated this order-online, pick-up in-store model. Clothing company Bonobos opened 10 stores in 2011 and plans to expand to 40 stores by 2016.

Amazon tried brick-and-mortar experiments before, such as Kindle vending machines that sold tablets and e-readers in malls."

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named — making it difficult to verify."
743,"Shocking video taken from inside an Afghanistan war zone reveals a Marine's unbelievable brush with death when a Taliban sniper's bullet hits him directly in the head as a fellow soldier's helmet cam catches it all.

The soldier survived to fight again following the 2013 insurgent ambush in the Now Zad District of Helmand Province thanks to his Kevlar-reinforced helmet.

It's a terrifying first-hand look at how close U.S. forces come to disaster each day as wars rage abroad.

Shocking video: A group of Marines fighting in the Now Zad District of Helmand Province in Afghanistan were ambushed by insurgents when a sniper's bullet struck one of them directly in the helmet. Video captured the shocking moment. From right to left, the group are seen leaving a desert building when the bullet hits the helmet (center and left) and lefts up a piece of fabric on the Kevlar reinforced helmet

Minor damage: The Marines run back to safety and the piece of fabric can clearly be seen missing from the Marine's helmet

'A Taliban sniper managed to get a non-fatal headshot on a Marine's helmet while the Marines were conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district,' wrote Sam Arnold, who uploaded the video to YouTube.

According to Arnold, the sniper shot was part of a 'U-shaped ambush by insurgents.'

The video starts as three Marines prepare to leave the protection of the ruins of a desert building. Just before they leave, the bullet hits.

Ringing in the ears: The Marine suffered some ringing in the ears but was otherwise okay following his brush with death

The struck Marine can clearly be seen falling back after the bullet hits him and all three men quickly retreat to safety.

'You lucky son of a b****,' one of the Marines marvels.

The men all inspect the helmet that saved him and the only evidence it shows of the impact is a missing piece of cloth.

The Marine himself says he's fine, too, minus some ringing in the ears, before the group all moves on to fight other battles.

744,"If North Korea's Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, is not running the Hermit Kingdom, then who is?

That presumes, of course, that the 30-something leader has run into serious health problems, physical or political, and no one yet knows that for sure -- only that he has remained out of public view for five weeks.

But in the opaque world of North Korean politics, that's enough to start a serious guessing game.

While North Korean officials quietly let the word filter out this week that Kim is doing just fine with an injured ankle, that hasn't quelled speculation on who might grasp the reins of power if they slip -- or have slipped -- from his chubby hands.

There are only a handful of possible pretenders to the throne, but perhaps the most intriguing is 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, who wields the ultimate trump card as youngest daughter of the late departed leader Kim Jong Il and granddaughter of the founder of the country, Kim Il Sung.

A think-tank operated by North Korean defectors, the North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, says she may be directing the government, at least temporarily.

As with most top figures in North Korea, particularly members of the Kim family, little is known of Kim Yo Jong, and much of that is a compilation of snippets of information.

One of the most extensive bios comes from Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch. He says Kim Yo Jong was been identified in the North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party of Korea, a powerful position indeed.

It was the first explicit mention of her in a state media report as a senior party official -- and a sign of her ascension.

Madden also says she works as an aide to her brother, Kim Jong-un -- something of a chief of staff -- running his public events, itineraries and logistical needs. In addition, she has ties to the Guard Command and Ministry of State Security.

Her biggest foray to the West came as a child when she attended elementary school in Berne, Switzerland from 1996 to 2000, using the name ""Kim Yo'ng Sun"" and living in the North Korean Embassy. Her brother, now Supreme Leader, was also studying nearby. Madden says that some photos of her as child were captured on home video by other parents at the school.

Kim Yo Jong has made periodic appearances in public, notably in December 2011 at various events held for her deceased father, Kim Jong Il. She has also been shown in the North Korean media in the background while her brother visits hospitals or children's camps, and can be seen sitting in the elite arm chair section reserved for high officials, though on the second row, at a concert attended by her brother.

Madden also says he believes she played a large role in planning Hwang's recent trip to South Korea, raising speculation as to which of these powerful figures had the upper hand in pulling it off.

""She is one of the only people in [North Korea] that we know has unfettered direct access to (Kim Jong Un),"" Madden tells Global Post. ""At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper.""

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who handled the North Korea portfolio with the National Security Council, tells CNN that if Kim Yo Jong, at age 27, is in fact running the country ""it means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

Among those already wielding power is Hwang Pyong So, who has moved up quickly under Kim Jong Un as vice marshall of the Korean People's Army and new chief of the General Political Bureau of the KPA.

Most important, he is vice-director of the Organization and Guidance Department for the Workers Party of Korea, a post that finalizes appointments within North Korea's leadership.

Hwang's rapid rise makes him chief beneficiary of a series of recent high-level military purges, including the arrest and execution of the Supreme Leader's uncle, Jang Song Theak, a four-star general.

Last weekend, Hwang, who is believed to be around 65 years old, led a North Korean delegation on a surprise visit to South Korea, ostensibly to visit the Asian Games, where North Korean athletes were participating. The delegation reportedly gave the South Koreans only one day's notice.

Hwang, decked out in his high-peaked cap, also held closed-door talks with top South Korean officials and agreed to restart long-stalled peace talks between the two countries, which are still technically at war.

Hwang's position atop the military structure offers considerable clout in a highly structured, tightly controlled North Korea and makes him a prime contender for the top spot.

Of course, in a secretive world like North Korea, powerful figures may well operate out of the shadows. One clue to the pecking order, though, is a favorite of old Cold War Kremlinologists -- seeing who sits next to whom at public events.

One well-placed figure, literally and figuratively, has been Gen. O Kum Chol, who was shown in July sitting two seats away from Kim Jong-un at a volleyball game.

As Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff, O Kum Chol's portfolio includes military strategy and planning as well as relations with foreign militaries. He is also a member of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and deputy of the Supreme People's Assembly, which gives him considerable clout.

On the other hand, the guy sitting between him and Kim Jong Un was none other than Hwang Pyong So.

Until Kim Jong Un's status is clarified, the speculation will continue."

Yes, we’ve all been having a good laugh at Fox News’ expense for hosting a “terrorism expert” saying that everybody in Birmingham is a Muslim and the entire city is a no-go area .

Especially on Twitter, where the #FoxNewsFacts hashtag has been a brilliantly British response to the ludicrous statement.

And then suddenly it looked like Fox News had got rather upset about the hashtag, and started responding from @FoxNewsPress .

Except, not really.

At the time of writing, the account has only made 25 tweets. And it appears it was set up in the middle of last night. Here’s their first ever tweet...

We can’t quite imagine a Fox News board meeting in the wee hours with someone shouting “Quick! The Brits are laughing at us with a hashtag! Activate a brand new Twitter account for our press team.”

Or approving of a Twitter account threatening individual users with legal action for making jokes.

754,"A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed that an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group’s main stronghold.

Jordan launches new airstrikes after vowing harsh war on ISIS

Dozens of Jordanian fighter jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites Thursday, intensifying attacks after the militants burned to death a captured Jordanian pilot.

As part of the new campaign, Jordan is also attacking targets in Iraq, said Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. Up to now, Jordan had struck ISIS targets in Syria, but not Iraq, as part of a U.S.-led military coalition.
The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers — which usually take place around midday on Fridays — in airstrikes that targeted “the same location for more than an hour.”

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed. It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building — but no images of Mueller.

American officials said they were looking into the report. Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, said the White House has “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates” the claim.


“We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,” she added.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters travelling with the president to Indiana Friday that the U.S. does co-ordinate with the Jordanian air force as they fly airstrikes. He wouldn’t say whether the U.S. was aware of the hostage’s location.

The Islamic State statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by the Islamic State and was also distributed by Islamic State-affiliated Twitter users.

Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Jordan was looking into the claim.

“But as a first reaction, we think it’s illogical and we are highly skeptical about it,” he said. “How could they identify a Jordanian warplane … in the sky? What was the American lady doing in a weapons warehouse?”

“It’s part of their criminal propaganda. They have lied that our pilot is alive and tried to negotiate, claiming he is alive while they had killed him weeks before,” al-Momani added.

AP Photo/The Daily Courier, Matt HinshawIn this May 30, 2013, photo, Kayla Mueller is shown after speaking to a group in Prescott, Ariz.
Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said. “It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.


A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, Obama said the U.S. was “deploying all the assets that we can” to find Mueller.

“We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,” he said in an interview with NBC’s Today Show. “Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.”

Mueller’s identity had not been disclosed until now out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after the Islamic State announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centres and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

The Jordanian military said that Jordanian jetfighters carried out “a series of attacks today and destroyed the targets and returned safely.” It did not elaborate or give a location for the airstrikes.

But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday.

A collective known as “Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently” said the planes targeted multiple Islamic State positions and headquarters in the western and eastern countryside of Raqqa, sending columns of smoke into the sky. Explosions could be heard in the city. The collective said there were no recorded civilian casualties, and did not mention Islamic State casualties.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of Islamic State members were killed in coalition airstrikes that targeted a tanks-and-vehicles depot in the area of al-Madajen and at least six other Islamic State positions, including a training camp and a prison.

755,"Less than two weeks after Aaron Sorkin said that Christian Bale would play Steve Jobs in the screenwriter's forthcoming biopic about the late Apple co-founder, Bale has dropped from the project. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale ""came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw"" before negotiations began. Sony, the studio releasing the film, had no comment on the THR report when contacted by HuffPost Entertainment.

Bale becomes the second high-profile star to bail on Sorkin's film within the last month. Back in October, Leonardo DiCaprio, who had been in talks to play Jobs, pulled himself out of consideration as well.

""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale,"" Sorkin said to Bloomberg Television in a recent interview when asked about the Jobs role. ""He really is a phenomenal actor.""

It's unclear who will replace Bale as the lead of the film, but other actors once rumored included Bradley Cooper, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Last week, it was also reported that Seth Rogen was in talks to play Steve Wozniak, but that casting has not been confirmed at this time.

Danny Boyle, meanwhile, is still set to direct the film. He replaced David Fincher, who was initially attached to the project. When Fincher departed back in April, THR noted that he had wanted Bale to play the lead role as well.

""I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bullshit news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured. Yalla, Acharai [after me]!"" 

Haaretz was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.



A second post uploaded to Rosenberg's Facebook page half an hour later read: ""All: On Behalf of Gill Rosenberg - please be advised that she is safe and sound. DO NOT listen to the reports for the past few days about kidnapping. I will update you again when I hear from her. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers!! Thank you!""

Several Islamist blogs and websites reported last week that Rosenberg
had been captured by ISIS.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying that Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

In her previous Facebook post on November 20, Rosenberg wrote that she would be without internet access for at least two weeks.

""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"" she wrote at the time. ""Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""

Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the
Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighboring Syria.

757,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- A journeyman professional golfer who has spent time recently giving lessons and caddying said in a radio interview that Tiger Woods has been suspended for a month by the PGA Tour -- a claim that the PGA Tour and Woods' agent vehemently deny.

Dan Olsen, 48, who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship, told 730AM The Game in Lansing, Mich., on Friday that ""I heard he's on a month's suspension ... it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person who is telling me this.''

[+] EnlargeTiger Woods

Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour.
Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand.

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.''

Olsen also talked about Woods using a ""cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension.

""I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com.

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen. 

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,"" Votaw said. ""We categorically deny these allegations.''

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.

Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open.

""Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world.

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.''

If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties.

But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor.

""They're not even going to remember the women,'' Olsen said, referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife. ""The women are going to take a distance second place. You're gonna talk about him with Lance Armstrong.''

The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year.

Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season. He also played the Web.com Tour in 2006, finishing with two top-10s in 27 events."

Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34

Origins: On 6 November 2014, an online rumor claimed actor Macaulay Culkin, best known for his roles in the 1990s Home Alone films, had died. That rumor was based on a Facebook hoax memorial page set up for the star:

At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.

The Facebook page memorializing the still-living star was soon taken down, but not before hundreds of thousands of social network users were duped by its claims. Culkin was photographed after the rumor began to circulate, alive and in the company of his bandmates:

But one man put that belief to the test ... and his surprising new video showing what happened after he gave a homeless man $100 has already racked up over 10 million views on YouTube.

Josh Paler Lin, whose YouTube channel has more than 711,000 subscribers and usually features pranks, thought he'd try a social experiment: Give a homeless man money, then follow him in secret to see what he'd do with it.

And sure enough, the man's first stop was at a liquor store. He emerged with a bag and took it to a nearby park. Well, what do you expect, right?

Wrong: Once at the park, the man pulled food from the bag and shared it with his fellow homeless.

""My heart was crushed,"" Lin told TODAY.


After witnessing what the homeless man, whose name is Thomas, did with the cash, Lin approached him on camera and explained that he'd been following him. He apologized and gave Thomas more money.

Thomas said that he'd quit his job to take care of his sick parents, then lost his family home after they died. He said he's been on the street for four months.

Lin decided to take action, setting up a crowdfunding page to raise money to help Thomas get off the streets. Donations thus far have topped $50,000. 

""People think I changed his life,"" said Lin, who maintains the video was not staged. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

763,"Following reports of Islamic State militants using chlorine gas to attack Iraqi security officials in Duluiyah, the United States has ordered a probe into the matter.
The National Security Council is reportedly in touch with Iraqi officials to gather more information into the chemical attack.
According to a Washington Post report, on 15 September at 4:20 pm, 11 Iraqi police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. ""Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes,"" the report noted.
The attack took place at Duluiyah where the security personnel, members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, were guarding a line in the north of the city.
After an exchange of fire, according to a survivor's account, the security personnel there were surprised to see ISIS fighters withdrawing from their position. And soon after that an explosion took place.
""It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,"" Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. ""I felt suffocated,"" al-Jabbouri said. ""I was throwing up and couldn't breathe.""
In an official statement, the Iraqi defence ministry also confirmed that ISIS had used chlorine gas against its forces. The statement, however, undermined the attack and said the ISIS used chlorine in a ""primitive and ineffective way"".
?
Back in June, after ISIS captured Al Muthanna facility -- where former Iraq former leader Saddam Hussein stored his chemical weapons -- it was feared that the Islamic State militants may carry out chemical attacks.
The use of crude bombs made using Chlorine only proves the extend the terror outfit is ready to go. ""We continue to take all allegations of chemical weapon use — and in particular these recent allegations regarding the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon — very seriously,"" spokesman for the National Security Council, Alistair Baskey told The New York Times.
""We are aware of the reports but cannot confirm details and are seeking additional information. The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region,"" Baskey added.
The reports of ISIS' chlorine attack in Iraq comes at time when reports claimed earlier last week that the Islamic State militants used mustard gas on Kurdish fighters in Kobane.
The Middle-East Review of International Affairs (MERIA Journal) even released a trove of photographs as 'proof' of ISIS using chemical weapons."
767,"Nasa has raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.

Nasa said that while a meteorite cannot be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside the capital, Managua, suggest something else was behind the event.

Photos showed a crater about 39ft wide in a wooded area near Managua's international airport.

The head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office, Bill Cooke, estimated that it would have been created by a blast of roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT.

Nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.

Cooke said: ""For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported … despite the population. So I'm very sceptical.""

There was no word so far of any meteorite fragments being found in the crater.

Rosario Murillo, a government spokeswoman and wife of the president, Daniel Ortega, said on Sunday that a relatively small meteorite was responsible for the phenomenon. The following afternoon she said scientists from other countries had expressed interest in coming to investigate.

Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said he could not confirm for sure it was a meteorite, but said that ""among the possibilities, it's one of the most likely"". He said he suspects a meteorite composed of rock.

Incer said it is possible nobody was looking up at the heavens when the event took place late at night. Residents described it as a loud boom.

""I was walking back home after playing billiards, and suddenly I heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong,"" said Victor Gutierrez, a 38-year-old mechanic who lives less than a mile from the site of the crater. ""I didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.""

Incer and Lindley Johnson, an executive for Nasa's Near-Earth Object Observations Program, agreed that whatever happened in Nicaragua had nothing to do with an asteroid that flew past Earth this weekend.

At the time of the explosion, the object known as 2014 RC was about as far away as the moon, Johnson said. 2014 RC's passage close to the planet happened about 13 hours later.

Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to ""someone out blowing things up""."
769,"The baby in the popular children's TV show Teletubbies has finally revaled herself as a university student.

Jess Smith, 19, was just nine months old when she became one of the most familiar faces on British television in March 1997.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun, who featured in all 365 episodes, has now revealed herself.

Jess was selected to overlook Teletubbyland as Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po had fun below.

Her decision to come out and 'say hello' came after her first week at Canterbury Christ Church university, when students were told to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

After holding back due to shyness, she eventually said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.""

Jess, a first-year dance education student, then broke the news on Facebook.

She posted: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com)

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.

""It was really weird seeing her on television.""

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

Correction: This post originally presented the video of a bird pooping on Putin as real, but comparison with Russian news footage from the event shows it to be a hoax. Putin’s unintentionally ironic speech decrying “excessive ambitions in war,” though, was very real.

Right here is where a media critic generally hammers the offender for naivete, stupidity and a failure to observe reportorial protocol. All of which applies to this instance, but hey, that fake pooping video looks pretty convincing, in part because the white blotch falls not on Putin’s dome — an obvious landing spot for a hoaxster — but on his left shoulder.

The Post’s “Know More” blog also fell for it. That post is now titled “Vladimir Putin gives speech on dangers of military aggression.” Its URL reads, “bird-defecates-on-vladimir-putin-during-speech-video.” It, too, has apprised readers that it got taken: “Correction: A bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday.

The former prisoner, being held in Qatar, is believed to have tried to make contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, officials told CNN.

NBC News reported that it’s unknown whether the man actually connected with the Taliban or if it was a true effort to actually rejoin militants. The name of the former detainee has not been disclosed.

From CNN:

[A]n ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.

Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being “suspected” of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the “suspected” classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as “confirmed” for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.

“We’re closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat,” an official told NBC.

The prisoner swap, which occurred in May, drew ire from lawmakers who said the Obama administration broke federal law by not first informing Congress.

The Washington Post newspaper named Emwazi and said he was a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming.
The BBC later said it too had learned that Emwazi was the suspect in question.
Police declined to comment on the reports.
""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counterterrorism investigation,"" said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.
In videos released by ISIL, the masked, black-clad man brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of three Americans and two Britons.
The Washington Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined ISIL."

According to a British military expert who has just returned from Iraq, ISIS has improvised a new weapon by putting live scorpions inside bomb canisters. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army and NATO head of chemical and biological weapons revealed that ISIS has thought of a new way to spread terror. He described it as ""madness"" and said ISIS promotes the use of scorpion bombs to create panic.

De Bretton-Gordon explained that scorpions are ""robust"" as the creatures can survive the impact of a launch even from a couple of miles. When the canisters break, thousands of scorpions will ""start crawling all around,"" the Mirror reported. Although not all scorpions are poisonous, the military expert said ISIS mainly wants to incite fear. The 2-ft scorpion bombs are not meant for mass casualties but are devised for maximum ""psychological impact.""

De Bretton-Gordon had returned from Baghdad last week where he took an advisory role to train Iraqi forces fighting ISIS militants. Senior officials in Iraq have reported that the scorpions were being used against civilian targets in the northern part of the country. Officials said the use of scorpions as weapons dates back to 198 AD when the creatures were stuffed into pots and thrown to enemies.

Meanwhile, ISIS militants in Mosul are preparing for an attack from the Iraqi government forces as they cut off telephone lines and imposed a ban on residents to leave the city. The Daily Telegraph was told that conditions in the city have deteriorated since ISIS is under constant pressure to fight back Iraqi ground troops.

A resident in Mosul revealed ISIS has imposed a rule that residents have to follow or else face punishment. The militants have warned residents to secure a guarantor if they wish to leave the city and come back after a few days. The Mosul resident, who asked not to be named, said people in the Iraqi city are trying to leave. Hospitals have shut down operations since there is no water or electricity.

U.S.-led coalition forces continue to launch airstrikes on ISIS targets as President Barack Obama has vowed that there will be ""no safe haven"" for ISIS. In a CNN report, Mr Obama spoke before military troops inside a New Jersey airplane hangar and reported that the U.S. was ""hammering"" ISIS by blasting supply chains and disrupting the terror group's chain of command."
777,"Mexican hitmen allegedly killed more than a dozen students who went missing last month after a clash with corrupt local police, then buried them in a recently-discovered mass grave.

State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed.

Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths.

Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico

The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh.

Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits.

It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure.

Security officials said earlier they believed the victims had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, executed and buried in six graves.

As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice.

'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.

Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43 missing students

Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students.

Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.'

Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.

Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of abducting some of the students, a local security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'.

He added that suspected gang members had told investigators that police had handed over the students to the people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

The suspected gang members had also helped the authorities identify the site, the security official said.

Soldiers and police had cordoned off the dirt track where it ended not far from the graves, which lay about a 40-minute walk across rocky terrain inaccessible by vehicle.

The fatal clashes took place in Iguala on the night of September 26. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

Information leading to the discovery of the graves had in part come from the interrogation of local police arrested after the clashes in Iguala, the security official said.

Guerrero state, home to Iguala and the resort of Acapulco, has been one of the most lawless in the country for years.

Officials said the remains of nine people had been taken down from the hillside so far, with another 25 due to follow."

The egalitarian message was included in a select number of Lego doll house products sold 40 years ago.

It since been shared by thousands online after a picture was posted on Twitter.

The note, calling for parents to look past gender stereotypes, says: “The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.”

While many sceptics questioned the authenticity of the text, Lego confirmed it is indeed genuine.

“The text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up,” said Lego UK’s Emma Owen.

“It remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world ... ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.”

780,"As the secretive state’s leader remains out of the public eye, analysts wonder if Kim Yo-jong has assumed the leadership

When Kim Yo-jong, was introduced to the public as a “senior official of the party central committee” in March, analysts speculated that she could one day become North Korea’s most powerful woman.

Now, as the country’s leader remains conspicuously absent from public life, it has been suggested that Kim Jong-un’s younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health.

Along with Kim’s wife, the former singer Ri Sol-ju, the 27-year-old is one of the country’s most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits. However, it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some, or even all, of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his “physical discomfort”.

“If Kim has indeed been set aside – and nobody outside Pyongyang really knows – then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight,” said John Everard, former UK ambassador to Pyongyang.“The visits to factories and military units that Kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else; they have simply stopped.”

“As a woman in a very male-dominated society, the theory goes, she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away, preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes.”

However, Everard says though it is “not impossible” that Kim Yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership, “it is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it”.

Kim Yo-jong, whose name is also spelt Kim Yeo-jung, is believed to act as an adviser for her brother, as other members of the Kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, before him.

Her elder sister, Kim Sul-song, for example, held a key role in the party’s powerful propaganda department under their father. Their aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband – Kim’s former mentor – was executed. She is now believed to be in hiding.

In the absence of independent media inside the secretive state, speculation about what lies behind Kim’s absence, and whether he is still in power, continues.

“The young leader’s absence certainly does deepen our questions about how their system might change or operate without him,” said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at Leeds University and editor of North Korea news and analysis website Sino-NK.com.

He too expressed doubts that North Korea might have quietly seen a woman take supreme power for the first time.

“Without Kim Jong-un in the forefront, North Korea’s government [remains] a highly conservative patriarchy run by old men for whom Moscow 1956 is the standard for dangerous liberalism. Regardless of who is in charge, it will keep the world on its toes – one thing that the state does extremely well.”"
781,"Turkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.

The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.

Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.

The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People’s Protection Unit (YPG) – a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.

'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,’ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.

'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.

'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'

He added that talks were continuing among officials on the details of the peshmergas' transit through Turkey.

One Turkish journalist close to the government said on Wednesday some 500 of them were expected to cross into Kobani this weekend

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

Earlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.

The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria."

Beheading comes one day after ISIS threat to America that 'we will drown all you in blood' following the US-aided Kurdish recapture of the Mosul Dam

Horrific video of American freelance photo-journalist James Wright Foley, 40, being beheaded by ISIS in revenge for US airstrikes in Iraq was posted to the internet Tuesday afternoon.
Foley, has been missing since November, 2012, after being taken hostage at gunpoint while reporting from Taftanaz, in northern Syria, for the agency, GlobalPost. 
ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.
In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'

The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. 
She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’
His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.
'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'
As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. 
It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.

Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. 
Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ 
As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.
In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.
'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.

The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.
Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.
‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.
'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 
'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 
'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. 
'So effectively, any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership.
'So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.’

At this point the executioner beheads Foley, who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back. His body is displayed with the head atop the body.
Then in another chilling warning, the executioner holds another man, on his kness with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck. A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff.
The executioner says: ‘The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.’
GlobalPost's co-founder, Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is 'no reliable proof that this execution is authentic.
'If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,' Sennott said. 'He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.' 
The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS.
'Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,' says Obama in a statement dated, August 7.
ISIS, which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group. 
Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd, 2013.
According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance.
Foley’s family including parents John and Diane, of Rochester, New Hampshire, have publicly appealed for their son’s release over the past two years.
Foley was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya.

The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U.S. targets 'in any place' in a chilling video showing a blood-spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English: 'We will drown all of you in blood'.
Unlike Al Qaeda, the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate, not spectacular attacks on Western targets.
It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops, supported by U.S. jets, had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam, hailing the offensive as a 'major step forward'.
The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies, and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives.
As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria.

Foley, who lived Boston, was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011.
He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family.
The Foley family from Rochester, New Hampshire, had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria, but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers, increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned.
'We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's okay,' his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance, 'Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed. To the people who have Jim, please contact us so we can work together toward his release.'
James, or Jim as he is known to his family and friends, is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley. 
Foley, who studied at Marquette University, Milwaukee, and later studied journalism at Northwestern University, Chicago, has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Prior to a career in journalism, he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago."
787,"A guru who ordered 400 of his followers to undergo castrations he said would bring them closer to God is under investigation by police in India.

The country's top crime fighting agency registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim - known as the 'guru in bling' for his penchant for garish clothes and jewellery - over the operations at his ashram.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Rahim is being investigated for criminal intimidation and causing grievous bodily hurt after an alleged 400 castrations were carried out.

'Guru in bling': Gurmeet Ram Rahim is being probed by India's Central Bureau of Investigation after a former follower alleged he ordered 400 men to submit to castrations he said would bring them closer to god

The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation based in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the murder of a journalist in 2002, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers.

The latest case was filed after one of his devotees, Hansraj Chauhan, lodged a complaint in court alleging he was manipulated into having the 'painful' operation at the ashram.

'They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet god,' Mr Chauhan's lawyer, Navkiran Singh, told AFP. 'We will put all the facts of the case to the court and seek compensation for the victims.'

Mr Singh said doctors carried out the castrations over a period from 2000, but for years his client had been too scared to come forward.

The court asked the CBI to carry out an investigation into the alleged castrations.

The Times of India reports that Mr Chauhan said he was castrated at Rahim's ashram by doctors acting on the guru's orders.

A court-mandated medical examination determined that Mr Chauhan had indeed been surgically castrated.

Rahim, 47, yesterday hit back at the accusations, telling a press conference convened to plug his new movie he is considering legal action of his own against his accusers.

'Such allegations disturb me, when I am doing good for humanity. Therefore me and my legal advisor are going to move the court challenging the allegations,' said Rahim.

Colourful: The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the 2002 murder of a journalist, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers

The Dera Sacha Sauda says it is a social welfare and spiritual organisation with millions of followers in India and broad.

On its website, the group describes Rahim as a saint as well as an author, inventor, scientist, philosopher, philanthropist, peace activist and 'the ultimate humanitarian'.

Rahim stars in an action movie to be released later this month called 'MSG: Messenger of God' in which the guru fights criminals, sings songs and is shown dousing himself in water in slow motion after a rugby game.

India has been rocked by numerous scandals involving popular godmen who are mostly Hindu ascetics claiming to possess mystical powers.

In November, police arrested Baba Rampal Maharaj after a long and violent siege at his ashram in Haryana when he refused to comply with court orders in a murder case.

In a bizarre case, devotees of a dead guru are fighting a court battle in Punjab state to preserve his body in a freezer, insisting he is only meditating.

For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects."

790,"The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed ""back of envelope"" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: ""[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being ""solid gold,"" it does say it is ""crafted from 18-karat gold,"" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. ""There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. ""The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."" Gold straps Gruber says a ""starting price"" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition ""is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

794,"Say it 'aint so!
Last week we told you about a YouTube prank that saw a homeless man get $100, only to turn around and spend the money on his peers.
However, we're hearing reports that Josh Paler Lin's inspiring video may be nothing more than a well-filmed prank!
Apparently, an eyewitness named Taugan Tan Kadalim claims he saw Josh and Thomas, the homeless man, in a car together outside of the liquor store in the video.
[ Video: Homeless Man Receives $100 & Doesn't Spend A Dime On Himself! ]
26-year-old Taugan says that he recognized Josh from his YouTube videos and wanted to stay to see what pranks he was going to get up to.
Well, instead of a prank, he says that Josh and Thomas were working together and that Thomas knew he was being videotaped.
We're not so sure that the video isn't real, mostly because it's so heartwarming that we don't want to think otherwise! Plus, the clip has raised more than $130,000 for homeless people, so it's doing some good whether it's real or not.
But what do you think??
Ch-ch-check out the video (below) and let us know in the comments if you think it's legit or if it's just a ploy to get famous!"
795,"A story is currently circulating about a teacher from Santiago del Estero, Argentina, named Lucita Sandoval who allegedly made a sex tape with a 16-year-old student, which then leaked on WhatsApp.

British tabloids like the Daily Mail picked up the story, going so far as to write that there would be a criminal investigation and that this isn’t the first time Sandoval has had sexual relations with a student.

The only issue with all of these sites covering the story of Lucita Sandoval, however, is that almost none of it is true, as Gawker points out.

Local Santiago del Estero newspaper Nuevo Diario debunked the Lucita Sandoval sex tape last week.

The sex tape currently going viral is believed to be a private sex tape that was shared to WhatsApp and then uploaded to streaming porn sites.

To make things weirder, the woman currently misidentified as “Lucita Sandoval” is becoming a celebrity on Facebook and Twitter. A friend of the woman cleared up her identity for Nuevo Diario.

According to her Facebook, the woman is a teacher, but not in Santiago del Estero — she’s from a different city called Corrientes. The man in the video isn’t 16 years old, either. According to his Facebook, he’s in college.

So now, not only is a random woman’s private sex tape going viral, news sites all over the world are accusing her of possibly sexually assaulting a student.

A somewhat similar hoax happened last week, when Chinese dating app Youjia created a fake advertisement for a woman offering to prostitute herself in exchange for travel costs.

796,"Apple Watch owners may never need to worry about being outbid in an eBay auction again, as a new job listing posted by the Internet auctioneer suggests advanced development of a bespoke Apple Watch app.

Those familiar with eBay know that keeping tabs on live bids is crucial to winning an auction, and eBay is apparently working on a project that could potentially stream results directly to your wrist, according to a recently posted job listing for an Apple Watch software engineer. The ad first appeared on eBay's official careers webpage in November, but gained wider exposure when it was posted to LinkedIn earlier this month.

According to the ad, eBay's Apple Watch app is being developed by the company's New Technology Group as an augmentation of its flagship iOS app, much like other first-generation titles announced by Apple. It is unclear if eBay for Apple Watch will work untethered, that is without constant connection to an iPhone, but with the wearable's Wi-Fi capabilities, such an implementation is in the realm of possibility.

An ideal candidate will have five years of experience in software design and development and at least three years experience developing iOS apps object-oriented design patterns and principles. Development experience with Android or Windows 8 is considered a bonus.

Alongside Apple Watch apps, eBay's New Technology Group is tasked with developing solutions for CarPlay, Apple TV and other ""opportunities within the Apple ecosystem."" The division is based out of Portland, Ore. and has over 200 employees in its ranks.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company's quarterly conference call on Tuesday that Apple Watch is scheduled to ship in April, just making a self-imposed ""early 2015"" deadline. The eBay job listing didn't specify if or when the Apple Watch app would be completed, but a two-month turnaround could be possible depending on feature depth and existing progress."
797,"A Chinese couple who can't afford live-saving medical treatment for their sick daughter are trying to sell their son on the street to raise money for her chemotherapy.

Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that with certain death awaiting their daughter unless she receives medical treatment, she and her husband were prepared to sell their daughter's twin brother to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

Meng Xiangyan pictured with her son as she tries to sell him on the streets of a busy Chinese city

The 29-year-old claims she and her husband love both their children, but they are willing to sell their son (pictured together) to a good home in order to try and save the life of his twin sister

The boy's twin sister (pictured with Xiangyan) is suffering from leukemia and requires life-saving treatment

In the pictures, he can be seen eating what appears to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appeals for someone to come forward and buy him.

She said: 'Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

'But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives.

'It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.'

Medical staff say the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10sqm flat close to where the chemotherapy is being carried out.

They are struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

Their attempt to sell their son follows a similar situation last month in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband Zhou Xinggui are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'"
798,"TOKYO — North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized after surgery on both ankles earlier this month, a South Korean newspaper reported.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the Chosun Ilbo said, citing a recent visitor to North Korea it didn’t identify. The person said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. In an unusual acknowledgment, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort,” and South Korea’s Yonhap News reported he is believed to be suffering from gout.

Tuesday’s report comes as Glyn Davies, the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, said the isolated state is neglecting its responsibilities to end its nuclear weapon program. Speaking in Beijing on a trip through North Asia, Davies told reporters Monday it’s essential that North Korea moves toward denuclearization.


“Today’s news may even prompt an acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear program, and missile tests,” said Hideshi Takesada, a professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo who specializes in North Korean affairs. “He’ll probably be keen to show there are no issues in the nation’s power structure.”
The activities of North Korea’s leader are the subject of intense scrutiny in Asia and beyond because of his family’s dynastic rule, its drive to develop a nuclear arsenal and the secrecy of a regime that faces South Korea across one of the world’s most heavily-armed borders.

In fractured ankle cases, a doctor may need to set the broken bone back into place with a splint or cast, and surgery may be required to repair the break, according to WebMD, an online medical dictionary. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full pain-free motion and strength, though most people can return to a normal routine in three or four months.

Even so, speculation remains in the South Korean media that Kim may be unwell. Footage in July and earlier this month showed the country’s leader walking with a limp, and Kim appeared to have gained weight.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society.

“It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.
“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” he said. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flare ups, which cause more pain.”

Sometimes the situation is solved, and other times, if the flare-ups keep occurring, the condition becomes chronic, Hepburn said.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to Britain’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

Surgery may be needed to remove gritty, chalky nodules known as tophi if uric acid crystals build up in joints, according to WebMD.

The South Korean government is cautious about making a hasty assessment of the situation given the amount of speculation over Kim’s disappearance from public view, Yonhap reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified government official. People will now be watching to see if he attends the anniversary of the Workers’ Party on Oct. 10., according to the news agency."
800,"Well, here’s the creepiest thing you’ll read all day. Australian Dylan Thomas found a tropical spider burrowed UNDER his skin after returning from a trip to Bali.

Thomas said that he noticed a strange mark on his stomach while vacationing on the Indonesian island. The mark started to grow, literally crawling across his body, as the spider explored the area underneath Thomas’ skin.

Thomas went to the hospital in Bali and was told that he was probably bitten by an insect. The doctors gave him some medicine and sent him on his way. Well, that didn’t exactly solve the problem.

Over the next three days the strange mark continued to grow. He eventually returned to the hospital where a dermatology specialist discovered a spider living under his skin.

Thomas wrote on Facebook: “Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that’s been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily.”

Dylan Thomas’ story started in a local Australian newspaper but has now spread all over the internet. Of course, there are some who question the veracity behind Thomas’ claim.

Snopes.com writes: “Thomas’ claims were widely reported but no recorded cases of a spider burrowing into live human tissue have ever been confirmed. Urban legends of spiders living under human skin or laying eggs have circulated for more than a century, but no evidence has emerged to indicate it is likely or possible for a spider to live under human skin … It is also worth pointing out that not only has a spider never been known to harm a human in the manner described, it also likely could not live for three days inside a scar and would probably suffocate in short order.”

803,"A goldfish lover from Norfolk paid hundreds of pounds in vets' fees when his pet became constipated.

The owner took his ailing fish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham where vets told him it was constipated and an operation would cost about £300.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetised water to knock out the goldfish before removing the blockages.

""At the end of the day they're all pets and everybody does have a commitment to their pet,"" Miss Bethell said.

""[The goldfish] was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"" she said.

The operation, which took almost an hour, was performed by Miss Bethell, assisted by two veterinary nurses.

""We've got one nurse who bubbles anaesthetic gas through a tube that goes in through its mouth and over its gills, and then we have a second nurse to monitor with a probe to check the heart rate,"" Miss Bethell said.

""Obviously, we discussed all the options [with its owner] and he made the decision to go for surgery.

A fake news story was published at a fake website this week claiming that Macaulay Culkin was found dead at his apartment.

The fake news story reads: “Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.”

This led to an “RIP Macaulay Culkin” Facebook page and numerous tweets from people mourning the loss of the world’s greatest child actor.

But if Macaulay Culkin was found dead at his Manhattan apartment on Friday afternoon, how was he playing a show with his band the Pizza Underground on Friday night?

Macaulay Culkin hasn’t released a statement yet about his current life-status but the several photos of the actor on the band’s Twitter account prove that he’s alive and well.





Of course, Macaulay Culkin isn’t the first celebrity to be “killed” by the internet. In recent months, Hulk Hogan, Chumlee, Chris Brown, and Sylvester Stallone have all been victims of a death hoax."

Suresh Kumar was set upon in Ganganagar, in India's northwestern Rajasthan state, after locals heard the girl's screams for help.

After finding the 40-year-old pinning the girl against a wall, a lynch mob dragged him to a butchers shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour before castrating him.

Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.'

But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'.

'We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.'

Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling.

The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice.

In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl.

The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends.

The trio were mercilessly beaten. One later died in hospital and the two others required extensive treatment.

That incident was a grim reminder of an incident in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh, some weeks before where two sisters were raped and then hanged from a tree outside their village."

People caught with marijuana in New York City may no longer face arrest – as the police consider implementing a ticketing system.

Under the scheme people found with small amounts of cannabis would be issued with a court summons but would not be handcuffed or taken to a police station for fingerprinting, according to The New York Times.

Low-level marijuana possession is one of the most common drug offences seen by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and law officials have been seeking a new way of addressing the problem.

Many low-level marijuana arrests take place in black and Latino communities, thereby impacting negatively on relations with police.

808,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female."

A fake article was published on the mostly fake news site DailyBuzzLive.com.

Here’s the disclaimer: “A few stories are works of complete fiction. Those few articles are for entertainment purposes only. The articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways.”

The story about McDonald’s is fiction.

As hoax-debunking site Snopes says, “in addition to the logistical impossibilities of weighing drive-thru customers, the potential lawsuits for discriminating against obese people, and the likelihood of McDonald’s losing millions of dollars in profits, the article can be debunked simply by considering its source: According to the Daily Buzz Live disclaimer page, all articles published on the site are meant for “entertainment purposes only.'”

Here’s what part of the fake piece says:

Obesity in America has more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the solution – not the problem.

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers with a weight capacity over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.

McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.”"
815,"The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. But for cord cutters (and cord never-getters) who want to tune in online, this year may mark the first time they've been able to do so without breaking the rules.

HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.

HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. Last year, HBO announced that it would finally unbundle its streaming services from cable in 2015, and the HBO Now launch could be signals that HBO is making good on that promise.

It's unclear how the HBO Now library would measure up to HBO Go's current offerings, but the companies are reportedly trying to wrap up negotiations in time for the Season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones next month. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service.

At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under.

Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service—but HBO has deflected the matter for years.

Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers—Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters."
816,"A previously unverified audio recording that allegedly captures the final moments of Michael Brown’s life has been verified as authentic, according to the video streaming application it was recorded on.

A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire, according to a lawyer representing the resident, whose identity has not been released.

The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot.

“A Glide user living nearby (whose identity is being protected) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed – to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,” Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. “Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second.”

The lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said she has shared the recording with the FBI. Federal officials won’t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident. 

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown’s death. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident.

They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver’s side window of Wilson’s police car. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. Some witnesses, viewing the incident from different vantage points, have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up, at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots.

The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it’s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be.

Days before the release of the audio earlier this week, Tommy Chatman-Bey, who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed, told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness.

“I was right out there when I heard it,” Chatman-Bey said. “I heard Boom, Boom, Boom, pause, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom and then some more.”

The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report. What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. But more curious are the time stamps on the document. Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account.

The report, released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law, suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19, 10 days after the fatal shooting. Final sign-off wasn’t given until Aug. 20, the report appears to indicate.

Glide in their statement said, “While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology. We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation.”

A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage.

Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull, according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown’s family. Lawyers for Brown’s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown. At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October."
817,"It’s been more than a month since North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un’s last public appearance. In the last 36 days, rumors have swirled, increasing in bizarre factor with each absent day — gout, diabetes, ankle problems, cheese-induced illness, etc. But the latest theory has nothing to do with his health. A group of defectors claim that Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-jong is now in charge of the dictatorship, at least temporarily while Kim recuperates, or finishes whatever it is he’s been doing on his hiatus.

The claim comes from the North Korea Intellectuals’ Solidarity, a Seoul-based advocacy think tank started by former North Korean professors. The group has not revealed its source, so it’s just an allegation at this point, but one that makes sense.

According to Michael Madden, who tracks the country’s officials with his North Korea Leadership Watch blog, Kim Yo-jong is one of the few people known to have “unfettered direct access” to the supreme leader, and Madeen speculates that she may currently be his “sole gatekeeper.”

The sister theory comes amid some more serious theories that a coup may be imminent. On Saturday, three elite North Korean officials made an appearance at the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea, one of which was Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) member Hwang Pyong-so. The OGD has long been rumored to be the puppet masters of Kim’s regime, only allowing the portly leader to be a symbolic figurehead for the sake of continuing the Kim dynasty. Hwang’s appearance only further suggests that the OGD have seized control of the regime.

But if video evidence of Kim limping is any indication, the dictator is likely recovering from whatever mysterious “discomfort” he’s been experiencing, and little sis is making sure things still get done, as little sisters often do.

Who Is Kim Yo-Jong?

While Kim has a half-sister, whom his father, Kim Jong-il had with another wife, Kim Yo-jong is his only full sister. Four years younger at age 27, Kim Yo-jong reportedly joined her brother for elementary school in Switzerland from 1996 to 2000. Currently, she is an official in Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), North Korea’s ruling political party. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, Kim Yo-jong works as her brother’s personal aide and manages his itineraries, public events, and logistical needs. Sounds like a hybrid of manager, publicist, and personal assistant.

The North Korea Leadership Watch notes her first public appearance in September 2010, when she attended a photocall for participants of the 3rd Korean Workers’ Party Conference, where she stood among her father’s staff. By the following year, she was a regular member of her father’s entourage, and at Kim Jong-il’s funeral in December 2011, state media revealed her leading senior party officials in bowing at the casket.

Before his death, Kim Jong-il included a “significant and unknown” role for Kim Yo-jong in his succession planning. Madden described her duties under the KJI regime to CNN, calling her

an “advance-team leader”

who inspected sites before official visits and performed administrative duties.

Now, Madden says, she has taken on even more responsibility as a regular fixture by Kim Jong-un’s side, receiving intelligence briefings and contributing to policy. In fact, Madden believes that she played a large part in planning the three officials’ trip to the Asian Games in South Korea. If true, this would suggest that the Kim dynasty is still perfectly intact, and a coup is just one of the many wild theories.

818,"NOTHING tops off a holiday in Bali like discovering there is a spider burrowing under your skin.

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas’ first trip to Bali last weekend was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.
21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval and heading upwards.

“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors early on Sunday morning, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

The burrow line started to blister
The burrow line started to blister
Later that morning he awoke to blisters.
“That’s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist on Monday, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan’s recent appendix removal.

“It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,” he said.

Dylan now has a reminder of his holiday in Bali

He has now earnt himself the nickname Spider-man.
“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days."

… that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola 

And:

World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance. 

If there is disease, spreading in epidemic fashion in Mosul it may not necessarily be Ebola since:

… Ebola symptoms — nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising — are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa.

Pests are now 'taking over' the newly-developed New York City premises and Anna Wintour no longer wants to step foot inside at all, reports claim.

This week, after rat droppings were allegedly found on an editor's computer keyboard, staff of all Conde Nast's titles were issued with a new rule: no eating at your desk.

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the New York Daily News.

'They ate through his rug to fit under his door.'

After numerous failed extermination attempts, the city's health authority has now been notified.

The setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year.

That's one famous mover: The Instagram feed for the Conde Nast owned publication showed rapper Will.i.am carrying boxes for them

Day in the life: The publication was tongue in cheek about the moving process

According to Gawker, Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she sets foot in their new home.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'

822,"A newly surfaced audio recording allegedly captures the exact moment that unarmed teen Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to an attorney for an unidentified man who lives in an apartment building near the site of the shooting, the recording captures as many as 11 shots fired in the Aug. 9 incident.

The audio, which was played on CNN Monday night, could not immediately be verified by The Washington Post. But a burst of gunfire can be heard (six shots), followed by a pause, and then several more shots (at least four).

“He was in his apartment, he was talking to a friend on a video chat, he heard loud noises and at the moment — at the time he didn’t realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” the man’s lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. “It just happened to capture 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

According to Blumenthal, FBI agents came to her office on Monday to interview the man about the recording.

The 12 second-audio clip is the only using a cell-phone app that only records short excerpts of a video conversation. It captured nothing before the shots began and nothing after. The man, who would like to remain anonymous, has asked that the accompanying video not be shown, Blumenthal said in an interview with The Post.

She first learned of the audio clip through the man’s roommate, who is a former client, and she urged him to share it with authorities.

“He was there when the event happened,” Blumenthal said, adding that he initially assumed the noise was fireworks not gunshots. “He is a very private person and he his not seeking publicity of any kind whatsoever. He was even unaware that this tape was relevant to anyone.”

Neither Ferguson nor St. Louis County police have contacted the man or Blumenthal about the video. After interviewing him on Monday, she said the FBI indicated that they planned to speak with him again on Tuesday.

Autopsy reports conducted by St. Louis County and by the Brown family found that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

825,"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday that US journalist Luke Somers was killed by militants during an operation aimed at freeing him from his Al-Qaeda kidnappers in Yemen.

""US Special Operations Forces conducted a mission in Yemen to rescue a US citizen, Luke Somers, and any other foreign nationals held hostage with him by Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) terrorists,"" Hagel said in a statement released during a visit to Kabul.

""Both Mr. Somers and a second non-US citizen hostage were murdered by the AQAP terrorists during the course of the operation.""

A grab taken from a propaganda video released by al-Malahem Media on December 4, 2014 purportedly shows US hostage Luke Somers, 33, kidnapped more than a year ago in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, saying that his life is in danger

A charity that had been involved in negotiations said the second dead hostage was Pierre Korkie from South Africa.

Hagel added that Friday's operation was undertaken when ""there were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger.""

""Several of the AQAP terrorists holding the hostages captive were killed in the mission,"" he said.

""The rescue attempt took place in central Yemen and was conducted in partnership with the Government of Yemen.

""Yesterday's mission is a reminder of America's unrelenting commitment to the safety of our fellow citizens -- wherever they might be around the world.

""I commend the troops who undertook this dangerous mission.""

Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
826,"American photojournalist Luke Somers, held hostage by al Qaeda in Yemen, was killed Saturday in a failed rescue attempt, his sister said. There was no immediate comment from Washington about operation, which Yemeni officials said was conducted jointly by the U.S. and Yemen.

The British-born hostage's sister, Lucy, told NBC News' partner ITV News and The Associated Press that the FBI had inform the family of the 33-year-old's death.

The operation took place in Shabwa province, a Yemen interior ministry official told NBC News, adding that 10 militants were also killed. It came two days after the Pentagon acknowledged an earlier U.S. commando mission to rescue Somers had failed. Teacher and photographer Somers, a British-born U.S. citizen, was abducted a year ago in Sanaa where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers and a local militant commander threatening that thwe hostage would meet his fate in three days if the U.S. didn't meet the group's demands.

827,"A Macedonian man who was dumped by his girlfriend when she told him he was not any good in bed chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin.

The man told medics that he felt his small sized penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he could not stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also lying in the bin. But although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they did not have the competence to reattach the member. Instead Ilic was transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje where surgeons managed to reattach it in a complicated five-hour surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it was a success whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis. Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away."

829,"By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: January 8, 2015 2:10 pm
A senior official of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) was on Thursday dismissed from service for unauthorized absence from duty for 25 years.
As disciplinary authority, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu directed dismissal from service of Executive Engineer (Electrical), A K Verma, after the charge of wilful absence from duty against him was proven in an inquiry set up to probe the matter.
A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter.
Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.
Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.
The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.
Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.
Verma’s case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.
The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matter"

A man accused of trying to rape a teenage girl is in a critical condition after locals hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver in a butcher shop.

After hearing terrified screams, an angry mob took the law into its own hands and dragged Suresh Kumar, 40, into a butchers in the city of Ganganagar, India.

He was found down an alley, pinning the terrified girl against a wall.

Following a community meeting, the vigilantes decided to drag him to a local butcher’s shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour, before chopping off his genitalia with a meat cleaver.

The remains were then dumped in the middle of the road with Kumar's bleeding body nearby.

Local Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

Police have called for those responsible to come forward.

A police spokesman said: ""People cannot take the law into your own hands.

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

""We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.

The man was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl was treated for shock, and given counselling."
831,"LONDON — The world knows him as “Jihadi John,” the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.

“I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of Emwazi’s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.”

[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

“There was an extremely strong resemblance,” Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. “This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.”

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley’s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

[Read: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings]

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: “Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi’s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It’s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

“I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,” he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.”

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had “heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!”

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

“This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,” Qureshi said. In the end, he felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions.”

Close friends of Emwazi’s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It’s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

“He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,” one of the friends said. “He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.”

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It’s unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility “the box.” Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed “George.” A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. “He was the most deliberate,” a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

“I was wondering if you could send me your number,” he wrote. “Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.”

There was no response.

832,"London, Nov 24 : Kim Jong-un has been guzzling litres of rare snake wine to perk up his love life with wife, it has been reported. The cases of the pricey plonk with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle were delivered at the supreme leader’s palace in North Korea, the Daily Star reported. Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improve the size of their manhood.

The 31-year-old despot, and his wife Ri Jol-su, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight. The ruler’s waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky. Sources revealed that the elite in the country joke that Jong-un is now too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.

Earlier he was missing altogether from the scene and his puzzling absence created a lot of curiosity. Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance for more than a month, with state media today reporting a visit to a new housing complex in Pyongyang. It marked the first time Kim has been seen since September 3 – an extended absence that fueled intense speculation, including rumours of a serious illness or even a coup.

The North’s official KCNA news agency said Kim made a “field guidance” tour of the new residential complex specially built for scientists working on North Korea’s satellite programme. ”Looking over the exterior of the apartment houses and public buildings, decorated with diverse colored tiles, (Kim) expressed great satisfaction, saying they looked very beautiful,” the agency said.

837,"On Friday, Nigerian armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced a ceasefire between President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration and the extremist group Boko Haram. Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the “chief of security” of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky.

The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram’s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute.

Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group’s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn’t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls’ release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria’s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram.

Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.

“It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,” Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.

Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it’s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks. The government said it has been working on negotiations with Boko Haram for months."
839,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the leader of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization in Africa, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia this week.

The leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was targeted Monday in an airstrike that hit a vehicle and compound in a militant stronghold south of the capital, Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab has been linked to a number of attacks in Africa, including the bloody siege at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed 67 people.

""Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

At the time of the strike, the Pentagon said it could not confirm Godane's death.

Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were used to strike the targets. Both manned aircraft and unmanned drones participated in the attack.

The Pentagon said no U.S. ground troops were involved in the operation.

""The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,"" Kirby said in the statement released Friday.

The United States has backed the Somali government, which has pushed the terrorist groups out of Mogadishu. Despite the government successes, the terror group has been able to operate in parts of the country that remain out of the reach of the government's influence.

The White House said it would continue to pursue the organization.

""Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal –- financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military –- to address the threat that al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people,"" the White House said in a statement."
840,"Suspected militant Islamists have shot and slaughtered people in three villages in north-east Nigeria, despite government claims that it had agreed a truce with them, residents say.

Boko Haram fighters raided two villages on Saturday, and raised their flag in a third, residents said.

The government said it would continue negotiating with Boko Haram, despite the alleged breach of the truce.

It hopes the group will this week free more than 200 girls it seized in April.

Boko Haram has not commented on the announcement made on Friday that a truce had been agreed, and that the militants would release the schoolgirls abducted from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok.

'Promise honoured'

Boko Haram is reportedly represented in the talks, taking place in neighbouring Chad, by Danladi Ahmadu.

However, Mr Ahmadu was ""bogus"" and an ""imposter"", said Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist with good contacts in Boko Haram.

The abduction of the girls sparked a global campaign to pressure the government to secure their release.

Government negotiator Hassan Tukur said Boko Haram had ""honoured its first promise"" by releasing 27 Cameroonian and Chinese nationals on 11 October, after capturing them in separate raids in May and July, Nigeria's privately owned This Day newspaper reports.

""Since it delivered on its promise to Cameroon, we expect Boko Haram to deliver on the release of the Chibok girls and the cessation of hostilities in north-eastern Nigeria,"" he said.

Chad's President Idris Deby is mediating between the two sides, Nigeria's government says.

'Friend killed'

However, Saturday's attacks have caused many Nigerians to doubt whether the government has really negotiated a truce with Boko Haram, especially as no statement has been issued by its leader Abubakar Shekau, says BBC Nigeria analyst Bilkisu Babangida.

Will 'truce' with Boko Haram free Chibok girls?

Boko Haram fighters burnt homes and killed many people during raids on the villages of Grata and Pina in Adamawa state, a resident told BBC Hausa.

As they marched from Grata to Pina, they also slit the throats of villagers whom they came across, he added.

In a separate attack, the militants raided Abadam village in neighbouring Borno state, and raised their flag over the village, a resident who fled the area told the BBC.

His friend was among those who had been killed by the militants, the resident said.

Many people had fled across the border to Niger, he added.

Mr Tukur said the government was trying to ""verify where the attacks are coming from"".

""As you know, it is difficult to have a ceasefire in an organisation that has many members and cells/units,"" he is quoted by This Day as saying.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram has increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture."
842,"A 280 pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in Italy. According to USA Today Sports, Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta. While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds, the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds. That does not mean that this wasn’t a record-breaking fish, however. According to the report, this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod.

According to the San Antonio Express-News, any catfish over 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare. Ferrari isn’t some small time fisherman, either. According to Grind TV, the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish, and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line.

“The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.”

The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see, as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole. He posed for photos with the fish, clearly very proud of his catch (even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures), which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in. It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big!

Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish, nor did he sell it for money. After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature, the guys released it back into the river, where it swam off, happy to live another day.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, these Wels catfish aren’t exactly harmless; this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into. And it is definitely not a “gentle giant” by any means.

“Dino’s monster catch is not the sort of fish you’d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping. The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path. These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers.”

Pictures of the 280 pound catfish are making waves on the internet today. Have you ever seen a catfish so big? Would you want to see a Wels catfish in person?

An anonymous Secret Service official relayed to The Washington Post that Omar Gonzalez charged through the front door and overpowered the Secret Service agent stationed there.

He then, reportedly, ran upstairs and into the East Room (the room where President Obama generally holds receptions or gives speeches). Gonzalez was subsequently tackled by a Secret Service agent in this room.

844,"Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!"
845,"It was an embarrasing moment for a Russian TV actor when he found out that his testicles have been stolen. Dmitry Nikolaev was drugged by someone after he left the Moscow theatre.

Doctors told him that his testicles have been surgically removed by someone with medical knowledge. It is believed that a gang selling human organs could be involved. The probe is on."
846,"Several Iraqi news sources, including Al Sabah and the website al-Maalomah, reported on Wednesday that several ISIS fighters sought help at a hospital in Mosul, 250 miles north of the city of Baghdad, after developing symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul, Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul. The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq.
The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report, quoting Iraqi news sources.
But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, Ahmed Rudaini, has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul. The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection couldn't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities. He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection.
Responding to inquiries from Mashable, a WHO spokesperson, Christy Feigh, said, ""We have no official notification that it is Ebola.""
Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed. But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria, it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases.
Mashable, however, reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously, an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas. It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents, further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group.
However, the symptoms of Ebola virus, including vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and typhoid fever. Thus, it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola.
Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers, it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group. It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported. Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak.
The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
Recently, Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country. The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas.
The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker, intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group, said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants.
Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014. The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured. Mosul, in particular, has been under ISIS control since June 2014. The city has reportedly suffered food, water and power shortages since extremist militants took over. Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children.
On Wednesday, the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq. The airstrikes in Syria targeted ISIS facilities in Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani, while the strikes in Iraq hit ISIS buildings and positions around Mosul, Fallujah and Sinja."
847,"“A Message To America,” a video uploaded Tuesday to YouTube, begins with a clip of President Obama announcing his recent authorization of targeted airstrikes and a humanitarian operation in Iraq. Then, around the two minute mark, a man believed to be James Wright Foley, 40, delivers a statement:

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers: the U.S. government,” he says, before specifically addressing his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force. (A full transcript of his last words was posted online by the blogger Brown Moses and can be found here.)

About two minutes and 20 seconds later, the man is apparently beheaded. His executioner, whose face is covered, has what sounds like a British accent and threatens that “any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Two people who know Foley said the man in the video appears to be him, and that the voice sounds like his. A Facebook page that is part of the Foley family’s appeal to find and bring Foley home posted the following statement: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

Foley, a freelance photojournalist for the AFP and GlobalPost, and his translator were kidnapped in Binesh, Syria, in November 2012. According to the FBI, his translator was later released.

The propaganda video ends with a shot of another kneeling man in orange believed to be missing journalist Steven Sotloff. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

A version of the clip viewed by BuzzFeed was removed from YouTube after about 20 minutes, though others have been uploaded since.

“YouTube has clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users,” a spokesperson for YouTube said. “We also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and used in an official capacity to further its interests.”

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” said NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden. “The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

848,"Washington (CNN) -- The man who jumped the White House fence earlier this month and breached the building's doors actually made it farther than originally thought, the Washington Post reported Monday.
Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who had a knife in his pocket, overcame one Secret Service officer and sprinted all the way into the East Room of the White House, where he was then tackled, the Post reported, citing ""three people familiar with the incident.""
Secret Service officials had previously told reporters that Gonzalez made it to just inside the north portico White House doors.
The Post reported that Gonzalez ran through much of the main floor, past a stairway that leads up to the first family's residence, and was ultimately stopped at the far southern end of the East Room. He also reached the doorway to the Green Room, an area that looks out on the South Lawn.

850,"THE spy agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the British fighter suspected of murdering the US journalist James Foley, British government sources confirmed yesterday.

The masked man with a London accent, who is said to be known as Jihadi John, was seen in the shocking video of Foley’s death released by the Islamic State extremist army last week.

While sources gave no details of the man they have identified, a key suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, who left his family’s £1 million ($1.78m) home in Maida Vale, west London, last year. He recently tweeted a picture of himself holding up a severed head.

The intelligence agencies and police estimate up to 20 British extremists a month are now travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State. The rate has risen since Islamic State declared a “caliphate” eight weeks ago. US ­officials said America was considering carrying out drone strikes on Islamic State leaders in Syria as it steps up its activities in the country, and could also provide more help for moderate rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad.

Pentagon sources claimed President Barack Obama agonised for weeks over whether to authorise a mission to rescue Foley and other foreign hostages. Delta Force commandos finally launched the mission on July 4 but the hostages had been moved.

“They were ready to go in June to grab the guy and they weren’t permitted,” said Anthony Shaffer, a former lieutenant colonel who worked on covert operations.

Writing in The Sunday Times yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused Foley’s killer of “an utter betrayal” of everything the British people stand for. “It is horrifying to think that the perpetrator of this ­heinous act could have been brought up in Britain,” he wrote.

Mr Hammond said Foley’s death was “a reminder to us all that Islamic extremism in Iraq and Syria is not only causing huge suffering in those countries but is also a barbaric ideology threatening us at home”.

Unless Islamic State is stopped, “sooner or later they will seek to strike us on British soil”, he wrote.

The comments are the most ­explicit warning yet from a British cabinet minister about the risk of an attack against the country.

The British government, he wrote, was “investing significant resources to tackle this problem for the long term” and to disrupt Islamic State’s ability “to organise, raise funds and attack us here in Britain”.

While “we must support the overwhelming majority of British Muslims who are moderate, law-abiding people with values and morals we all share ... we should be in no doubt that we have a vital ­national interest in tackling the threat from Islamic State,” he said.

Government sources insisted that while the option of British air strikes on the jihadists remained on the table, they “are not being actively considered or proposed at this stage”.

Military planners are, however, drawing up plans to deploy scores of British troops to help train a “substantial” number of Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.

Training will focus on the use of heavy weaponry such as artillery, mortars and Milan antitank weapons.

Sources said Britain was exploring the possibility of establishing training camps in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq and in Baghdad, although the high security risk meant the training could take place in Jordan or Britain instead.

851,"Not only has the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic likely found an actor to play Jobs, it may have found an actor to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak too: according to The Wrap, Seth Rogen is being considered for the role. Variety reports more definitely that he's actually set to play it. Rogen would be acting alongside Christian Bale, who is reported to have taken the part of Jobs. Danny Boyle, who made Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, is directing based on a script by Aaron Sorkin. Jessica Chastain is also reported to be under consideration for a part, though it isn't known who she would be playing.

THIS ISN'T A DONE DEAL YET

Rogen is certainly an interesting casting choice, but with how little is known about this movie, it's hard to really gauge what it means. For one, it's not clear how large the role of Wozniak will be: the film is supposed to take place in the moments preceding three major Apple product launches, and Wozniak wouldn't necessarily be around for all of those, having left Apple in 1985. We've also seen successful pairings of strong dramatic actors, like Bale, with traditionally comedic actors, like Rogen, in the past to quite a bit of success — see last year's The Wolf of Wall Street, for example — so it's possible that Boyle is trying to emulate that here.

That all said, The Hollywood Reporter says that it isn't clear if an offer has been made to Rogen yet, but that the film's producers do want him on board. The Reporter also says that Bale's deal is yet to close and remains at a delicate stage — though Sorkin has suggested that he's on board. This Sorkin-scripted Jobs film has had a rocky development process and has already had to restart once, when David Fincher was dropped from being its director. Still, it's sounding more and more like the studio behind this film is eager to get it made, so perhaps we'll see some confirmation on all of this soon."
852,"After a solid week of coming to terms with the fact that Steve Jobs is Batman, we've found ourselves in a Job-less world once more. Now that Christian Bale's thrown in the tiny circular glasses, we ask you, dear readers, who's your Jobsian ideal?

So share your top picks down below, and help us find the perfect Steve to Seth Rogan's (presumably) stoned, ever-guffawing Woz."
853,"It's a common practice around the world to speed up TV shows in order to insert more commercial time. The subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a 22 minute sitcom with little noticeable difference--and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour! It's a last ditch effort, perhaps, to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model. TBS does it with Seinfeld reruns (see below) and worldwide it happens all the time--from the BBC to India.

But is that all there is to it--trying to make more money? Actually many viewers point out that TV shows (and everything else) move faster now in the age of the 6-second Vine. The speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary. Here's one commenter: ""Honestly, shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version. But who even watches actual TV anymore? No TV + adblock on 90% of internet = very little advertising = happy me :)"""
854,"Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.

Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.

Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.

His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.

For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.

Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.

Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.

Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.

BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating."
855,"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.

The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.

No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.

Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.

Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.

In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.

In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""

On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that ""we know"" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.

For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.

""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""

Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.

Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.

""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"" Kasper wrote. ""We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.

Our ruling

Hunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis.

All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

856,"Kim Jong-un has broken both of his ankles and is now in the hospital after undergoing surgery, a report in a South Korean newspaper claims.

The North Korean leader has been missing for more than three weeks, fueling speculation about what could cause his unusual disappearance from the public eye. Some rumors indicated that he was suffering from gout, others speculated it was a sign of some sort of internal struggle within the secretive North Korean regime, and some even said he was simply getting ill by eating too much Swiss cheese.

But on Tuesday, South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo added a new twist, reporting that Kim was hospitalized in mid-September and had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, a hospital for high-ranking government officials in the capital, Pyongyang.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" an anonymous source was quoted as saying.

Apparently, Kim sprained his right ankle while wearing Cuban heels during a tour of military bases and factories, the paper reported. Kim was seen limping in July during a TV appearance.

The paper said that Kim was still in the hospital, under heavy protection from bodyguards, and was receiving visits from several government officials.

This rumor seems to confirm what North Korean state media had said on Thursday, when state broadcaster Korean Central Television reported that Kim was ""not feeling well,"" and was suffering from an ""uncomfortable physical condition.""

858,"Is Fidel Castro dead? Yes, a man named “Fidel Castro” has died, but he’s not the famous Castro you might be thinking of. The prospect that the leader of Cuba might have died is circulating on the internet, and the rumors claim Fidel Castro’s death was supposed be announced at an official conference, according to the Castro health rumors, but already Cuba has denied these rumors.

In a related report by the Inquisitr, it’s claimed that Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond series, helped former President Kennedy to hatch a Fidel Castro assassination plot.

According to the el Nuevo Herald, the rumors claimed Fidel Castro dead because a man named Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of an important politician in Kenya, died over the weekend at the age of 14 years old.

“Castro Odinga was the son of Raila Odinga, the main opposition leader in Kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father. It is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of Twitter, and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the Cuban leader.”

Kenyan police are currently investigating Odinga’s death, and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the Cuban leader.

According to Laiguana TV, it’s also possible that a blog by Yusnaby Perez may have sparked rumors that claimed Fidel Castro dead because he had not been in public in many months.

“How strange! It is the first year since I can remember the anniversary of the Revolution that Fidel does not appear.”

Thursday marked a year since the former Cuban president made a public appearance. Castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in Havana, but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between Cuba and the United States that was announced on December 17, 2014.

The rumors were increased even further when Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Fidel Castro’s death. The newspaper quickly retracted its report, but not before the alleged “news” about Castro went viral.

Because of these rumors several media outlets in Venezuela and Cuba claimed the Cuban government planned on calling a press conference to discuss Fidel Castro’s heath condition. But an official from the International Press Centre (CPI), the department Cuban Foreign Ministry serving foreign media, says this rumor is false, saying,

“That is false. No press conference was convened, no.”

In addition, Castro’s influential nephew, Alejandro Castro Espin, who is currently in Greece, told a radio station his uncle is “in good health” and there’s no reason to speculate about Castro’s death."

867,"The Isis militant known as Jihadi John has today been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi

The British Isis militant known as Jihadi John has been identified in reports today as Mohammed Emwazi, from London.

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post, identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages, a 2010 report in The Independent is cited, which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa, before being let go.

It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip.

Below is the full report, in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam, from The Independent on Saturday, 01 May, 2010.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5' (from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for “days” in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: ""I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: ""The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""

A government spokeswoman said the Security Service ""operated within the law"" and complaints about officers' alleged behaviour should be made to the independent commissioner who has the power to investigate allegations."

A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it.

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns.

""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""

Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim.

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.""

Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""

Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.

The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.

Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.""

At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border.

Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.""

The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.

He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.

Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""

872,"The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from West London.

The IS frontman is believed to have appeared in a series of shocking videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, are brutally murdered

The 27-year-old was named this morning by the Washington Post and it is understood he is known to British security services.

The paper described him as being from a well-to-do family in West London, graduating from college with a degree in computer programming.

MORE: Desperate plea for missing schoolgirls ‘heading to Syria’

A friend said: ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.’

His friend added that he was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation.

British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be ‘accurate and correct’.

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London said: ‘We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.’

Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, ‘Jihadi John’ reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

According to the article, in 2009/2010, Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait, where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him – but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials.

Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. He was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ‘George’.

The ICSR said: ‘Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

‘The fact that ‘Jihadi John’ has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one’s identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

‘This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

‘British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide bombers, hostage takers, and executioners.’

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met’s counter terrorism command, said: ‘We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

‘We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.’

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi’s name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ‘The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

‘There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.’"
873,"(CNN) -- New York City will apparently change its policy on marijuana possession, giving officers the option to merely ticket offenders instead of requiring an arrest, a law enforcement source told CNN on Monday.

The new policy, reported Sunday by The New York Times, is expected to be announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton at a 3 p.m. ET news conference.

Police will have some discretion in deciding whether to issue a ticket or make an arrest, according to the source.

Unlike in some places that have legalized recreational marijuana, New York law still bans possession of the drug. The policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law.

874,"Following the deadly shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism, cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed Wednesday in the best way they knew how: with their own set of tribute cartoons. Artists from The Independent, The Washington Post, and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack, which took the lives of 12 people, a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists. (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed Wednesday.) And — for those who flocked to Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media Wednesday — it appeared that Banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy. But, come Wednesday night, fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that, no, Banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image.  

Though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a Banksy Instagram account, it’s believed that the account does not belong to Banksy himself. Not only because Banksy’s official website insists that the artist keeps off social media — specifically referencing his lack of a Facebook or Twitter account (this short-lived Instagram was the only account that was ever linked to Banksy) — but also, as Business Insider notes, the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with Banksy’s notoriety. Writes the site:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn’t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.
That said, the image itself is striking, and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in Paris. So, though it’s possible Banksy did not design the cartoon (and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute Banksy would publish), it’s worth digesting, appreciating, and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech."
877,"Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?"
879,"Matt Taibbi is taking a “leave of absence” from Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, according to New York Magazine. The move comes “after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.”

Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi.

The “leave of absence” also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization.

I’ve previously had a… uh… spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were “not for publication” — a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that’s about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today’s news. He replied: “No, you may not.”

Here then, for what little it’s worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was… uh… spirited on both sides. All words below are mine — you’ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi’s stated position might have been.

A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a “not for publication” conversation. Given First Look’s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn’t being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi’s words redacted. I’m sure some readers with disagree — I welcome the discussion.

Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando’s Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn’t discuss this post with Mark before publishing.

Ok, here are the emails…

[The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed ""Not for publication.""]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story] Right, but that’s not the part that seems to have changed. What’s changed is that Omidyar’s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It’s gone from finance first to politics first. More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there’s clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it’s launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology.

[Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 I don’t think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I’m leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what’s going on.

[Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted.] If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look. I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response? As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don’t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis. Here’s what I believe… I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you’re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well, than you are. I’m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it — just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back. Best of luck, Paul

[Taibbi responded again.]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014 I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I’ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying. At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis. [Redacted] I’ve told you what I believe, but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again, this time line by line… [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think it’s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I’d say the odds [are] almost zero. He’s not that fucking stupid. Here’s what I said “No, of course I don’t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.” Here’s my question, which you don’t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn’t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable? A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan? Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry! — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look? [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I’ve never said otherwise. That’s a total red herring. [Redacted Taibbi quote] [Redacted] I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I’ve made clear, I don’t believe that would make any sense); I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don’t know. What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed. [Redacted Taibbi quote] A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging. Your choice of denial is interesting. “[Redacted]” That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street. Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture”? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Yes, that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind “not for publication.” Why, if you’re being so unfairly maligned, won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner? Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)? You’re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers. Paul

Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.

When I emailed him earlier today, I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments. He replied: “Just that your story was wrong then and still is.”"
880,"Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video on Tuesday that shows the apparent beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley — with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to put an end to US airstrikes.

Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist kidnapped in 2012, was forced to recite anti-American hatred from his Islamic State in Iraq and Syria captors as his final words before a masked killer put the knife to his neck.

The video — which was posted on YouTube until the site yanked it down — shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert area. His head is shaved. Behind him is a man covered head to toe in black. It’s titled “A Message to America.”

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes in Iraq.

A stone-faced Foley — who was last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse — then bravely reads a clearly coerced statement.

“I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don’t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,” he said.

“I call on my brother who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.”

As a final insult, his last forced words were, “I guess all-in-all I wish I wasn’t American.”

The video then shows another American — Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff — and the group says he is next unless the US backs off.

He is being held by the collar as he kneels in the desert, also wearing prisoner orange and a shaved head.

Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013. His last Tweet was about his hometown Miami Heat.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

White House National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said they’re analyzing the video of the beheading to determine its authenticity.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said.

ISIS had warned the US of the potential murder in an earlier video saying, “We will drown all of you in blood” in retaliation for US airstrikes that have been pounding them.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

US Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said the video reveals ISIS for the true murders they are.

“ISIS is the worst of the worst,” King said. “These guys are truly animals.… We have to go after them and destroy them.”

Foley family friend Holly Rene, who lives in their hometown of Rochester, NH, told The Post, “These savages have got to be stopped. It’s coming West.”

She said the family is “falling apart with grief.

“I was just so hopeful Jimmy had, if they weren’t going to get any good news, that he would have been dead for a long time now and there was no suffering involved. And to think he went through two years just to have this ending, it’s beyond belief.”

Foley’s family had set up website to plead for Foley’s return — and urged patience on Tuesday.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the Find James Foley Facebook wrote: “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

Foley, one of five children, had been captured previously in Libya for 45 days in 2011.

He graduated from Marquette University in 1996 and later studied journalism at Northwestern University.

He penned a letter to Marquette Magazine thanking the community for its prayers when he was captured in Tripoli with two colleagues. He recounted getting to call his mother from prison and learning of the university’s prayer vigil for his release.

“If nothing else, prayer was the glue that enabled my freedom, an inner freedom first and later the miracle of being released during a war in which the regime had no real incentive to free us,” Foley wrote. “It didn’t make sense, but faith did.”"
882,"The British Islamic State militant who has featured in videos featuring the execution of Western hostages, known as ‘Jihadi John’, has been identified.

The man is Mohammed Emwazi, a young British man from West London who was known to British security services.

Security agencies did not disclose his name earlier due to operational reasons.

Emwazi is thought to have killed American journalist James Foley in a video released last August.

He is further believed to have featured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

Emwazi is reported to have links with a former UK control order suspect who fled to Somalia in 2006 and has alleged links to the funding of militant group Al Shabab, which recently threatened to carry out terror attacks on London’s Oxford Street.

He is a computing graduate from Queen’s Park in West London, who traveled to Syria in 2012 and later joined the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).

One of his friends told the Washington Post he had “no doubt” that “Mohammed is Jihadi John.”

“He was like a brother to me … I am sure it is him. There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person,” he added."
883,"There may be yet another bug in iOS 8, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.

MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that ""no data or media will be deleted,"" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.

The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.

iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to ""safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud."" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.

Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.

One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.

The launch of iOS 8 has been a PR nightmare for Apple. One update managed to stop iPhone 6 users from making calls, and Apple was forced to pull the update and quickly work on a fix.

885,"An asteroid about 60 feet in diameter missed hitting Earth Sunday by about 25,000 miles, as predicted by NASA’s Near-Earth Object program.

It did not, contrary to some reports Monday, break off a little piece that landed with a bang in Nicaragua.

That story was intriguing to asteroid watchers, including the scientists at the Tucson-based OSIRIS-REx project, which tweeted Monday:

#Nicaragua impactor: the second serious impact in as many years that was undetected #chelyabinsk

NASA officials, though, are skeptical that the reported explosion and crater near Managua’s airport was caused by a space object.

On Tuesday, the OSIRIS-REx twitter feed was reporting that skepticism.

It pointed to an article by Bill Cooke, lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office, who wrote on NASA’s “Watch the Skies” blog that someone would have surely seen the meteor streaking toward Managua, which has a population of more than 2 million.

“... the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause. The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.”

Steve Larson, of Tucson-based Catalina Sky Survey, said the Managua explosion was also out of sync with the passage of asteroid 2014 RC, which was first spotted and observed by the sky survey’s telescopes on Mount Lemmon on Sept. 1.

The asteroid made its closest approach on Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Tucson time. The Managua impact was reported 13 hours before then, Larson said.

It would have been a good story — if true.

Rich Kowalski, the Catalina Sky Survey astronomer who found 2014RC, had previously spotted two other small objects that later struck Earth, in 2008 and again last January.

No one else has done that and this would have been his third one. 

At OSIRIS-REx, where scientists are planning a NASA mission to capture and return pieces of an asteroid they have named Bennu, asteroids that could turn into meteorites are big news.

In addition to bringing back pristine space rocks, the mission also promises to increase scientific knowledge of asteroids and the impacts of various forces on their trajectory — good things to know should we ever need to defend ourselves from a predicted approach.

Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx, said the first tweet about the Managua impact was a little embarrassing, but was quickly countered by skeptical ones.

He said the mission wants to be immediate and newsy with its social media, but also needs to apply ""some scientific rigor."""
886,"Chinese parents who don't have the money to pay for treatment for their critically ill daughter have gone onto the street to try and raise the money by selling their son who is the girl's twin.

Mum Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that she and husband loved both of their children, but with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from  acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

Their attempt to sell their son follows on from a similar story only recently in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'

According to That's Magazines, she was also in possession of another poster that stated: 'Boss fled after industrial accident and we don't have the money for treatment. I'm willing to sell my child to save her father.'

Many locals who witnessed her in distress were sympathetic to her plight.

Although some gave her money, no-one offered to purchase her daughter in the four hours she sat in the street with the sign, the magazine reported."
887,"Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy’s unbelievable tale isn’t from a comic book — it’s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

Extending her arms out, Marinela Brankova was able to support a 15-pound weight from her vertically turned palm, according to the book “Far Out: 101 Strange Tales From Science’s Outer Edge” by Mark Pilkington."

Lucy Somers told The Associated Press on Saturday that she learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Lucy Somers said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""

However, Yemen's defence ministry released a statement claiming that armed forces early on Saturday freed ""an American hostage"" being held by al-Qaeda and killed 10 members of the militant group holding him, Reuters reported.

Luke Somers was abducted in September 2013 in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This week, the Pentagon confirmed it launched an earlier failed raid to rescue him.

Somers' reported death comes as a Yemeni security official said a suspected US drone strike at dawn Saturday killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants in the country's southern Shabwa province.

Tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying nearby after the strike.

900,"A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's ""project manager"" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

902,"A Jordanian government spokesman has denied rumours that the Jordanian King Abdullah II, a trained pilot, is personally conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State (Isis).

Mohammed al-Momani said in a statement that reports about the personal involvement of the King in combat missions on IS targets is unfounded and baseless.

Rumours on King Abdullah spread after the he promised to fight back hard against IS, saying that the death of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh ""will not be in vain"".

""We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground,"" he said on state television.

Momani had revealed earlier that Jordan will intensify its efforts with an US-led coalition against IS.

Later on Wednesday, Abdullah vowed ""relentless"" war against IS, saying Jordan will ""hit them on their own ground"".

Iraqi news outlets cited unofficial sources saying that the king was personally flying a plane. Jordanian author Waleed Abu Anada tweeted:

BREAKING: Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow. #IAmMoath— Waleed Abu Nada (@waleedabunada) February 4, 2015

Before becoming king, Abdullah II was a general in charge of Jordanian special forces and a certified Cobra Helicopter pilot. In 1980 he joined the UK's Royal military academy Sandhurst.

After the barbaric video of Kasasbeh burning to death emerged, The Royal Hashemite Court's Facebook page published a picture of the King in pilot gear:

The picture was retweeted several times and used by some as a proof that the Jordanian king was gearing up to fight IS in person.

903,"A video has surfaced purporting to depict American journalist James Wright Foley being beheaded by those who claim to be ISIS rebels. James Wright Foley disappeared in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012.

The video features text saying “Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” It then cuts to a clip of Obama announcing airstrikes against ISIS and then to Foley kneeling in orange, next to a man wearing black with his face covered. In it, Foley is forced to read a letter urging Americans to rise up against his “real killer,” the “U.S. government.” I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killer, the U.S. government. What will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.”

According to Time’s Mirren Gidda:

American airstrikes began earlier this month in an attempt to help thousands of people—members of the Yazidi, an ethnic minority in the region—who were trapped on a mountain range by fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). President Barack Obama formally told Congress on Sunday that he had sanctioned additional air raids, though he said they would be limited. The new strikes, requested by the Iraqi government, were intended to help Iraqi and Kurdish security forces who had been battling the militants for control of the strategic Mosul Dam. Aided by U.S. air support, these troops successfully recaptured it on Aug. 18.

The video also shows a man on his knees who is allegedly Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who went missing in Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. According to the video, Sotloff’s fate depends on Obama’s “next decision.”

Detailed Analysis

 
Report Claims McDonald's To Stop Serving Overweight Customers
According to a 'news' report that is circulating via social media and the blogosphere, McDonald's has decided to stop serving its products to overweight customers in a move designed to fight against growing obesity rates.

Supposedly, the fast food chain will implement the new policy on January 1st 2015. The report explains that scales will be installed in front of each register and customers will have to stand on the scales before ordering. Customers who weigh-in higher than Macdonald's pre-determined weight standards will not be served, claims the report.

Report is False - McDonald's Has Not Announced Such a Policy
However, the story is - of course - a work of fiction.  McDonald's has certainly not announced any plans to implement such a policy.

908,"ISIS supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as 'martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child's alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: ""That's my boy.""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

909,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. —Research Medical Center said a patient who came to its Brookside Campus emergency department for treatment does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.

The hospital issued the statement to stop rumors and online reports that the patient was being treated for the disease.

""These reports are inaccurate,"" said HCA Midwest Health spokeswoman Chris Hamele.

She said the patient was taken to the hospital's main campus, where he being treated appropriately for his illness and is responding well in good condition. The man had one of the symptoms of Ebola and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

The symptoms of the disease can include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and bruising.

Local health officials have said it's extremely unlikely that the patient has Ebola.

Family members with patients in the emergency room at Research Medical Center said it was business as usual there on Sunday.

""If it's something we should have been concerned about, I think they would have said something,"" said patient Collette Harvin.

Marcus Mitchem, who was visiting a patient, said Ebola is a scary thing to think about.

""The most concerning thing about the Ebola virus is no known cure. You get it, you die. That causes concern for everybody,"" he said.

Several Americans who contracted Ebola while in Africa have returned to the United States and responded well to treatment, in part due to safety protocols at American hospitals.

Hamele said Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions, and is well-equipped and well prepared to implement them.

""As health care providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high quality care to our community as we always have,"" Hamele said.

Harvin said she's not really afraid about Ebola.

""We have measures here. We have medicine,"" she said. ""If we were in Africa or something like that, I'd be a little more worried.""

The Kansas City Health Department said in a tweet that local hospitals have procedures to protect patients, staff and visitors from infectious diseases. It said it has complete faith that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps.

""It's important to remember,"" the Health Department tweeted. ""You cannot get Ebola unless you handle bodily fluids of someone who has Ebola.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reminds the public that it's not spread through casual contact or the air.

More than 3,000 people have died from the outbreak. About 2,000 U.S. troops are already helping Ebola-affected countries. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that number could grow to 4,000."

Rival militias have fought for control of the airport since mid-July, inflicting civilian casualties and extensive damage. But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge.”

Now, US intelligence suggests one or more of 11 planes from Tripoli, Libya could potentially find their way to New York and Washington D.C. According to the Washington Free Beacon, one official stated ” We found out on September 11 what can happened with hijacked planes”. The official went onto to say:

“The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.”

A State department official dodged the question concerning legitimacy of the report, according to the Washington Times, and stated “I can’t confirm that”.

Joint military exercises, as of August 20, have begun to include simulations to intercept a passenger or military plane that is piloted by terorists, Magharebia reports.

“The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday.”

An analyst named Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia:

“These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries”

The question remains, how should the US respond to escalation of attacks overseas?

921,"Agence France Presse
LONDON: ""Jihadi John"", the masked ISIS militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, was Thursday named as London man Mohammad Emwazi by the Washington Post and the BBC.

Britain's Metropolitan Police would not confirm the report, which identified the suspect as Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who grew up in west London.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation,"" said Richard Walton from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command.

Contacted by AFP, the interior ministry could not immediately comment on the reports.

The Guardian and the BBC both reported the identity, without citing their sources.

British media had previously suggested ""Jihadi John"" could be a different British jihadi.

Emwazi, in his mid-20s, was identified to the Washington Post by friends and others familiar with the case, with one close acquaintance telling the paper: ""I have no doubt that Mohammad is Jihadi John.""

The suspect is from a middle class family and earned a degree in computer programming before traveling to Syria around 2012, according to the report.

He apparently became radicalized after being detained by authorities following a flight to Tanzania and being accused by British intelligence officers of trying to make his way to Somalia.

""Jihadi John,"" named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British accent, is believed to be responsible for the murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig.

He also appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

In the videos posted online, he appears dressed all in black with only his eyes exposed, and wields a knife while launching tirades against the West.

Following the appearance of the report online, UK-based terror expert Shiraz Maher tweeted ""Well, that's it. The name is out. Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammad Emwazi.""

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 homegrown militants fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

924,"What’s wrong with building a snowman? Plenty if you ask a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia. A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ‘Fatwa’, forbidding the building of snowmen. According to the cleric the practice is highly anti-Islamic.

The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn’t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. To this, the cleric replied in the negative, saying,

“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Sheikh Munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. Under the Saudi kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, such an action is considered a sin. While noting his ruling, he added,

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,”

In simpler terms, the cleric was OK with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other “inanimate” objects only. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn’t what the religious leader pondered much upon.

Fortunately for the children, the fatwa hasn’t been accorded a date of implementation and moreover, no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law.

The country’s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. Despite being the second hottest country in the world snow has covered a few upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia’s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

928,"ISIS terrorists have released a video purportedly showing the beheading of American freelance photojournalist James Wright Foley who went missing on Thanksgiving Day in 2012.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native, was kidnapped at gunpoint from an Internet café in Syria. ISIS has threatened that Steven Sotloff—another freelance reporter who has been missing since August 2013 and has written for numerous publications such as Time, Christian Science Monitor, and Foreign Policy—will also be executed depending ""on Obama’s next decision"" regarding U.S. military strikes against ISIS in Iraq.

In the graphic video, Foley was forced to read a letter encouraging Americans to rise up against his “real killer”—“the U.S. government,” adding that the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS “hammered the final nail into [his] coffin.” Apparently, his executor was heard in the video speaking English with a British accent."
931,"The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.

The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.

Lebanese security officials described the woman as a “high-value catch” and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadi’s DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.

The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.

Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.

“It is close to impossible that she would have operational details,” said an Iraqi intelligence officer. “But she could still be useful on things like locations.”

Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraq’s north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (£6.4m) bounty on Baghdadi’s head.

Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanon’s military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.

Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraq’s central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.

Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video’s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that “the Dane is doing better.”

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria."
932,"India is going through some serious public sector reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So not turning up for work for a quarter of a century is now not OK, as one civil servant found out recently.

India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD), in a press release dated Jan. 8, 2015, announced the dismissal of a senior electrical engineer employed by the department for 35 years. He only worked the first 10.

It sounds like the CPWD could use a bit of reorganisation. The employee stopped turning up for work in 1990, and an inquiry was launched in 1992. The department then seems to have forgotten about it for 13 years:

Charges were clearly established six years ago, but Verma apparently remained in employment for another eight years until he was sacked today. It's not clear from the press release whether he was paid over the whole period. In 2014, a German civil servant admitted he hadn't done any work in the last 14 years, but Verma beats him by a decade."
933,"Islamic State militants released a video on Tuesday purporting to show the beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing since he was kidnapped in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012. Foley was abducted by unknown gunmen outside a cafe in Binesh, along with his translator, who was later released.

Another captive is shown at the end of the video. He is identified as Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who has been missing since August 2013.

The video has not yet been independently verified. The video and images were released on Twitter by user @mujahid4life. The account has since been suspended.

A freelancer known for his work covering conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, Foley had contributed work to GlobalPost, Agence France-Presse, and various other outlets. In 2011, he was kidnapped and held by pro-Qaddafi forces in Libya before being released after 45 days.

""Captivity is the state most violently opposite his nature,"" his friend Clare Morgana Gillis, a journalist who had been kidnapped with him in Libya in 2011, wrote in a piece last year for Syria Deeply. ""But when we were detained in Tripoli, Jim automatically turned his energies to keeping up our strength and hope.""

In the video, the man identified as Foley delivers what appears to be a prepared statement.

""I call on my friends, family, and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government,"" he says. ""For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.""

He goes on to decry the American aerial operation in Iraq, and ends by saying, ""I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. But that ship has sailed. I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.""

A masked militant attired in black stands beside him. 

""This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country,"" the militant says, brandishing a knife in his left hand. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. So effectively any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The video then shows the militant begin to cut the man's throat with the knife before fading to black, followed by a graphic image of his body.

The militant then appears standing beside the man identified as Sotloff.

""The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,"" he says."
936,"Islamic State (Isis) militants in Mosul may have contracted Ebola, according to Iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an IS-controlled hospital in the city.

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries and Africa"", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

938,"A group of ISIS militants in Iraq have allegedly gone to a local hospital to be treated for what is believed to be Ebola.

Three local media outlets reported this week that a number of ISIS fighters have shown signs of the deadly disease and were taken to a hospital in Mosul to be treated. The reports are currently unconfirmed, but the World Health Organization says that they are investigating the claims and that they are attempting to reach out to officials in the area to offer help.

“We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,” WHO’s director of communications Christy Feig told Mashable in a statement.

Feig reportedly went on to acknowledge that, despite their best efforts to offer help to area officials, if Ebola has in fact reached them, having an impact in an ISIS-controlled area could prove to be challenging.

Ebola reached epidemic levels last year in parts of Africa, and fear that the virus would spread in the United States took over the headlines for weeks this past fall. However, so far, the disease has yet to make any serious impact in the states.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper al Sabaah claims that the disease has spread to Mosul through “terrorists” coming from “several countries” in Africa.

Symptoms of Ebola include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bruising, and severe bleeding, but any of those ailments could be attributed to a number of other conditions, so it’s not entirely clear if the reported Ebola diagnoses are accurate.

939,"The “Jihadi John” killer who has featured in several Islamic State beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle-class family who grew up in London, the BBC and the Washington Post newspaper reported Thursday.

WHAT THE VIDEOS SHOWED

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons. He was made famous in a video showing the death of American captive James Foley in August of last year.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST AND BBC ALLEGE

WHY DID HE JOIN ISLAMIC STATE?

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London. They said Emwazi and two friends – a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib – never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster.

Oh, and who could forget those Amazon lockers you could choose to route your goodies to? Amazon's vision for its role in the real world has evolved a bit since then -- the Journal notes that the New York outpost could act as a way to highlight its own products like Fire TV, but the bigger draw is the space's role as a same-day product pickup location/customer service hub. Think about it: you'd be able to purchase something from Amazon and schlep down to the store on 34th Street to pick it up. Not exactly what you expected? You'd be able to return it to that very same spot.

944,"(CNN) -- A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month.

The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9.

The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon.

""A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,"" the company said.

The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000.

Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed.

The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual.

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The significance of the pause

Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death, and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car.

Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.

Read the police reports

Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said.

Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car.

Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events.

The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds.

Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

945,"Christian Bale will slip into a mock turtleneck to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming film about the Apple co-founder. (The one that has nothing to do with Ashton Kutcher.)

Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and he's jazzed to have Bale on board. ""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Chris Bale,"" Sorkin told Bloomberg Television, explaining that Bale didn't need to audition.

The movie, based on Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography on Jobs, is named after the Apple idol for a reason. The Jobs character is going to dominate the screen.

""The role is an extremely difficult role. He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined,"" Sorkin said. ""There isn't a scene or frame that he's not in, and there's a tremendous amount of language.""

Bale is a good actor, and he has just the right balance of prickliness and genius to nail Jobs. But who is filling the Woz role? Sorkin didn't say. My vote is for Jonah Hill (if the real Woz isn't available, of course.)

Danny Boyle is set to direct, meaning we have an Academy Award-winning screenwriter, director, and actor on board. Meaning this movie might be awesome.

In her blog, the author, known only as Lena, wrote that she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ‘the donator’.

Describing the pregnancy as a ‘diagnosis’ she said that she was ready to have a child.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women’s rights ‘to the point of eschewing a career’.

But from her writing – if what she’s saying is actually true – she appears to be something of a misandrist.

She wrote: ‘One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances.’

So when she went for an ultrasound on the baby and it turned out to be a boy, she reacted with the man-hating bile that the rest of her blog seems to follow.

This was her reaction: ‘I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.’

And the lack of perspective just got worse: ‘Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just… sheltering me.’

Thankfully after mourning for three days at the thought of bringing another ‘monster’ into the world, she regained her mental health.

So she popped along to an abortion clinic and had the foetus removed.

She concludes: ‘I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

‘If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.’"

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo.

Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched an attack on IS militants near Tikrit.

The city was among the areas in Syria and Iraq seized by IS this year.

Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the SOHR, said IS was using Iraqi officers who were pilots under ex-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to train fighters in Syria.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said.

It is not known how many Iraqi pilots have defected.

Witnesses told the SOHR the planes appeared to be MiG-21 or MiG-23 models.

The BBC's Sally Nabil in Baghdad says IS has three planes which it captured earlier from the Syrian military in Aleppo and Raqqa.

US Central Command spokesman Col Patrick Ryder told Reuters the Pentagon was ""not aware"" of IS conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere.

Aleppo became a key battleground in the fight between Syrian rebels, which now include IS, and government forces after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

New coordination

Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route.

Correspondents say that past efforts by the government to regain territory in the area have ended in failure.

Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane.

US-led warplanes struck IS positions on Friday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town's Kurdish defenders.

The BBC's Kasra Naji, on the Turkish-Syria border, said the day began quietly but there had since been around six strikes.

On Thursday, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal told the BBC that the militants had been driven out of most of Kobane.

Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting.

The battle for Kobane, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab, is regarded as a major test of whether the US-led coalition's air campaign can push back IS.

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.

More than 160,000 people have fled in the face of the IS advance.

Capturing the town would give the group unbroken control of a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

IS fighters have gained a reputation for brutal tactics, including mass killings and beheadings of soldiers and journalists."
951,"THE beheading of American journalist, James Foley, at the hands of ISIS militants shocked the world but forensic experts have revealed the video was probably staged, with the murder happening off camera.

The UK Times reported that an international forensic science company, which has worked for police forces across Britain, said there is no question Foley was beheaded but that camera trickery and post-production techniques look to have been used.

“I think it has been staged,” said one expert in visual forensics, after he was commissioned by The UK Times to examine the footage.

“My feeling is that the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped.”

Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum think-tank, said over the years ISIS militants have improved the production quality of their videos.

The analysis by experts has highlighted a number of inconsistencies that could suggest that the beheading of Foley, which was seen on the video, was not his actual death.

Firstly, no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times. Secondly, sounds allegedly made by Foley do not appear consistent with what may be expected.

The forensic analysis expert said that no incision could be seen on Foley’s neck, though the right hand of the jihadist partially blocked the shot.

While the forensics company, which asked to remain anonymous, did not reach a definitive answer they did conclude that at some point an execution of Foley did take place.

This comes as a heartbreaking last letter from Foley to his family has been revealed on the Free James Foley Facebook tribute page.

While Foley was not permitted to send the letter, a fellow hostage, Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, memorised it word for word.

The 25-year-old spent 13 months imprisoned with Foley and when released in June his first call was to Foley’s mother, Diane, where he dictated every word.

Foley describes fond memories with his family and how he and the eighteen other hostages being held with him are coping.

“I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray,” Foley said in the letter.

“I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.”

Foley goes on to describe his hopes of attending his sisters wedding and his plans to take his grandmother out when he returns home.

“Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita’s when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.”

The full letter can be read here.

Yesterday, British security services MI5 and MI6 reportedly identified a British hip-hop artist as the key suspect in the hunt for the killer who beheaded American journalist James Foley.

The Sunday Times newspaper said Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, from Maida Vale in West London, had become a crucial part of the investigation.

The paper attributed the information to “senior government sources.”

Bary, 23, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges in New York tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John”.

In June, The Sunday Times revealed a threat made by Bary on Twitter. “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels),” he wrote. “Beheadings in your own backyard soon.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled Overdose, Flying High and Dreamer.

But he was reportedly radicalised by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush West London home last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

Also under investigation are Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, the MailOnline reported.

Mail Online reported that al-Britani was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Since joining ISIS’ brutal campaign in Syria al-Britani, real name Junaid Hussian, has worked to fund the ISIS war chest by mounting jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities.

Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, meanwhile, is active on social media using Twitter to post pro-ISIS propaganda. According to Mail Online, he is believed to be behind an account on the ask.fm social media site giving young people advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and encouraging them to join the jihad.

Other possible identities for “John” include the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and travelled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, the Daily Mail reported.

EBay, whose website allows people to buy and sell all sorts of things both new and old, is seeking an iOS Engineer/Architect who can work on “elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app,” according to a job posting from the company.

The listing was first published on eBay’s job page in November, but it has been getting more attention thanks to its appearance on LinkedIn this month, according to a report today from AppleInsider.

E-commerce companies like Flipkart have developed apps for Android Wear watches. Now, as Apple gears up to start shipping the Apple Watch in April, e-commerce companies will presumably develop for it, too.

Apple first announced the WatchKit software development kit for Apple Watch in November.

But eBay isn’t only interested in the Apple Watch as a development platform. In addition to an Apple Watch app, eBay’s New Technology Group is planning “solutions” for CarPlay and Apple TV, according to the job posting."

956,"BAGHDAD — The Islamic State (IS) has been accused of using chlorine gas against Iraqi soldiers who were besieged in Anbar province. Survivors of an Iraqi army regiment in Saqlawiya, near Fallujah, say the radical group used the gas against the besieged soldiers. There were conflicting government statements about whether the gas had been used.

The siege on the regiment, which consists of nearly 400 soldiers, has created an uproar in Iraq, with Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) on Sept. 21 demanding the government break the siege. 

The following day, the Anbar Operations Command said it opened the road to Saqlawiya, ending the siege of the soldiers. These statements seemed to be an attempt to ease the anger of MPs and the public at security leaders for leaving the soldiers besieged without any support.

The incident came shortly after the massacre in the Speicher military base in Tikrit, where nearly 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets were killed. The investigations are still ongoing, as the victims’ families continue protests, blaming security leaders for failing to protect the lives of the cadets.

The testimonies of the survivors from the Saqlawiya incident, which were posted on YouTube, have shown the extent of negligence on the part of security leaders toward the soldiers, as well as the lack of serious attempts to save their lives as the siege lasted five days. The biggest surprise in the testimonies was that IS has chlorine gas and used it against the besieged soldiers.

The MP in Qadisiyah province south of Baghdad held a news conference in the Iraqi parliament, during which they blamed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces. The soldiers who hail from the province have suffered from the neglect of military leaders, in spite of repeated appeals seeking protection for the service members.

MP Ali al-Badri said, “Three hundred soldiers were killed in Saqlawiya."" Badri, citing survivors’ testimonies, said, “Terrorists used chlorine gas for the first time.”

Sabah al-Jouburi, a professor at Salahuddin University in Salahuddin province, said IS had used chlorine gas in its war against the army for the first time.

Reports previously suggested IS has over the years obtained chemicals to be used in its war against the Iraqi government seize cities. Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on terrorist groups, pointed Al-Monitor to “the use of chlorine gas by the group [now known as IS] in 2005, in the bombings of a popular market in Abu Ghraib.”

Hashimi said, ""In early 2014, IS was able to obtain large quantities of chlorine gas when it took control of water treatment plants in Fallujah and Saqlawiya, and in Mosul and Salahuddin following the fall of Mosul on June 10.”

Yet, Hashimi said it appeared that IS had not used chlorine gas “in any direct or indirect fighting” with the army. He said IS knows the gas is not that toxic, “can only kill in enclosed places, and loses its effectiveness when heat is generated from the explosion. It can only be used to induce intimidation.”

“Experts have not been able to prove its use in the battles of southern Dalouiya and Saqlawiya,” he added.

Anbar police also said that chlorine gas had not been used on the soldiers in the province.

While Maj. Gen. Ahmad Saddag al-Dulaimi, Anbar’s police chief, told Al-Monitor by phone, “We heard news that IS used chlorine gas in the Anbar battles,"" he said, ""This news is unfounded, and chlorine gas has not been used during the battles at all.” He added, “If it indeed had happened, we would have told all media outlets about it and announced it.”

On the other hand, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said, “Terrorist organizations used chlorine gas in some areas close to water treatment plants, but did not have an impact. For the gas to have a lethal effect, it should be used in mass quantities, which the enemy does not currently have.”

Although the ministry asserted that “no injuries were reported for now in the regions where the organization used chlorine gas,” it issued instructions “for the purpose of increasing security measures.”

In a statement obtained by Al-Monitor, the ministry advised the members of the armed forces and civilians to “cover their faces with a wet cloth to protect themselves from the potential effects [of chlorine gas]” in case they hear IS is using it."

The Amanita muscaria was found growing wild in the extensive palace gardens during preparations for a television show.

The mushroom's hallucinogenic properties have long been known and it has commonly been used in rituals.

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of naturally occurring Amanita muscaria.

The mushroom can be beneficial to trees but can be poisonous to humans.

Officials say mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens."
958,"An animal lover from Norfolk splashed hundreds of pounds on an operation to save his bunged-up goldfish.

The man took the pet, which he keeps in a tank in his office, to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre after noticing it was suffering from digestive distress, EDP 24 reported.

He apparently originally declined the operation when told it would cost £300, but quickly changed his mind.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetic water to knock the goldfish unconscious before clearing blockages with the intricate procedure.

""He was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"" she told the BBC.

The lucky pet, which is a member of the carp family, survived the 50-minute operation before going home with his owner. Bethell used a small heart rate monitor to ensure the fish was sufficiently drugged before using a mini-scalpel to remove several blockages near the anus and dorsal fin.

""I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp,"" the vet added. The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated.""

Bethell has performed a string of odd operations recently, including removed a stone from the 5mm ureter of a guinea pig and castrating a skunk."

A Vogue employee told Gawker that the new offices are infested with rats. And the problem is apparently so bad that the editor-in-chief is reportedly refusing to enter the premises.

Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she clicks her dainty heels into their new home.

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

Vogue, however, is not scheduled to move into the 1 World Trader Center until the new year, giving ample time for the removal of the rodents.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'

Meanwhile, Wintour has defended her decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the April cover of Vogue, but now it appears she is suggesting that the choice was 'tasteless'.

According to Fashionista, the magazine editor said: 'I think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover, it would be a rather boring magazine!'

Day in the life: The publication was tongue in cheek about the moving process

She added that even from the very beginning, Vogue was never about pleasing everyone. 'The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too,' she explained.

'It's such a long time ago probably no one remembers, but she was a very controversial figure. Now she's part of the establishment.'

Ms Wintour, 65, went on to say that if Vogue didn't reflect modern culture - even the more provocative figures within it - 'nobody would talk about us. It's very important that people do talk about us.'"

962,"A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.

Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000.

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.

He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a Kurd

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said ""You've just eaten him.""'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

964,"Doctor in besieged Syrian town reports arrival of patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties after explosion

Kurds battling Islamic State militants for control of Kobani fear the extremist group may have used an unidentified chemical weapon, according to officials and one of the few doctors still working in the besieged Syrian town.

Patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties turned up at a clinic after a blast was heard on Tuesday evening, Dr Walat Omar said. He described the symptoms as abnormal and said he could not identify their cause, but suspected a chemical weapon.

“After a loud explosion [on Tuesday night], we received some patients with abnormal symptoms. They reported a bad smell which produced some kind of allergic reaction,” Omar said in a telephone interview that was periodically disrupted by heavy explosions.

“Some had red patches and blisters on their skins, others had difficulties breathing and others were vomiting, with painful throats, and others with burning eyes and noses. There was one patient, all his body was covered in red patches and blisters.”

Islamic State (Isis) is thought to have obtained stocks of ageing but still potent chemical weapons when it seized Iraqi army bases where they were stored, the New York Times reported earlier this month.

In June, the group took control of a sprawling complex that had been the heart of Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons programme, Al-Muthanna State Establishment. There may also have been chemical weapons buried or abandoned elsewhere, that were not destroyed by US forces or the Iraqi military.

Stocks manufactured before 1991 are dirty, corroded and not always easy to identify or use, but can still cause serious injury.

Iraqi officials said 11 police officers were poisoned by chlorine gas last month, when Isis fighters used it to attack the Iraqi town of Duluiya. All the officers survived.

That attack was hundreds of miles from Kobani, near the Syrian border, where Omar said he feared eight civilians had been injured by some kind of chemical attack.

Intense fighting has made it impossible to get doctors the equipment they need to do definitive tests for the use of chemical weapons, but Omar said they displayed symptoms distinct from anything else he had treated in weeks of heavy battles.

He said he had ruled out chlorine gas or biological weapons, based on his medical training, but thought the injuries were caused by a chemical. Trained in Ukraine, he is originally from Kobani and returned there to work after seven years at medical school.

“This is the first time we have seen this kind of condition,” Omar said. “I have seen other strange conditions but nothing like this before.”

The opinions of chemical weapons experts consulted by the Guardian were divided after seening a series of pictures provided by Omar of a young man with large skin blisters and a severely swollen lip.

The pictures did not have any metadata to confirm the time and place they were taken, but had not been published on the internet before Omar provided them to a Kurdish journalist.

One expert with personal experience of treating mustard gas victims said that, although the blisters were not typical, the symptoms overall were consistent with a possible sulphur mustard poisoning. That could only be confirmed with a urine or blood test.

Other experts said that while the symptoms could be consistent with exposure to a chemical agent, they were somewhat unusual and other medical conditions, such as a severe allergic reaction, would need to be ruled out.

Senior Kurdish politicians said they feared a chemical attack, and had asked for testing kits to seek confirmation.

“Many people were injured … and showed symptoms of chemical weapons use: choking, breathing difficulties, bleeding eyes, burning skin etc,” said Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of the Kobani administration. “Some of the doctors say that it might be phosphorus or poison gas of some kind, but the investigation is ongoing, we don’t know for sure.”

It is possible that Isis fighters could mistake some chemical munitions for ordinary weapons and use them without being aware of what they are handling. It could also be harder to evaluate the impact of attacks using partially degraded weapons, one expert said.

“Various factors might contribute to far milder symptoms than those normally associated with mustard agent exposure under combat conditions. These could include impure or degraded agent, short-term exposure, or exposure to a limited volume of agent,” said Jean-Pascal Zanders, a former analyst with the chemical and biological warfare project at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The bomb believed to have caused the injuries treated by Omar exploded at about 10pm in west Kobani, near a hospital. Omar said he thought Isis may have targeted the medical centre to try to undermine morale, although it was not being used and none of the forces defending the city were in the area.

“Some fighters were further away, they complained about their eyes watering and burning, and pain in their nose,” he said, estimating that around 20 of them were affected but needed only basic first aid.

Regarding civilians who were closer to the blast, Omar said he was treating affected patients with oxygen, the steroid cortisone and other drugs until about 2.30am, as well as fielding calls from people who did not want to leave their homes.

The three most seriously injured patients, who ranged in age from 17 to over 40, stayed in the clinic overnight for observation and Omar was trying to arrange for their evacuation to Turkey for further treatment.

One Kurdish activist said Kobani may have been hit by teargas for the first time, perhaps drifting across from a Turkish border village where police had been using it for weeks to break up crowds of demonstrators. It has not been deployed in the intense battles for Kobani and so would not be recognised by residents, although demonstrations nearest to the border have almost all been in daylight hours, while Omar reported victims arriving well after nightfall.

965,"A luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods, the golfer, is up for sale.

The 62-acre island, in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was the former home of the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, to whom he was married for six years.

It boasts six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole, features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge and its very own landing strip for propeller planes.

The island also includes a protected quay, private ferry boat, historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

However, potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building does not come with furnishing.

Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is listing the island, said: ""This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

""This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

""Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice. The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

""Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

""A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

""This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to Mälaren's over 1,000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.

""This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.

""The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake.

""The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion.

""The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.

""You go for a swim in Lake Mälaren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer.

""Apart from the island, the property also includes the two small Skinnpälsarna islands and a water area of around two million square metres.""

966,"A meteorite landed ""like a bomb"" just missing Nicaragua's main airport and raising concerns over scientists' ability to track space objects on potential collision courses with Earth.

Officials said they ""thanked God"" there were no injuries as the rock landed in Managua, a sprawling city of 1.2 million people where it left a crater 12 metres (40ft) wide and five metres (16ft) deep.

The object was believed to have been a small part of the asteroid 2014 RC, nicknamed ""Pitbull,"" which astronomers had been monitoring as it passed the planet.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids that come relatively close to Earth but 2014 RC, which is the size of a large house, was only discovered on Aug 31.

It moved within 25,000 miles of the Earth's surface and had been projected to be at its nearest point over New Zealand on Sunday.

The meteorite that apparently originated from 2014 RC landed in a wooded area just before midnight on Saturday.

Its impact registered on instruments used to detect earthquakes, which regularly hit Nicaragua.

People living nearby head an an explosion and described seeing liquid, sand and dust blowing thought the air, and the smell of burning.

Jorge Santamaria, who lives near the airport, said: ""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

Jose Millan, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event.""

Nicaragua said it would be asking for assistance from international scientists, including those from the United States, to investigate.

The composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground.

Wilfredo Strauss of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: ""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact.

""You can see two waves on the seismic equipment). First, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit Earth, and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound.""

Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua's First Lady and Government spokeswoman, said the object ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

In February 2013 a meteor that had not previously been detected by scientists exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: ""The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth raises some interesting questions.

""Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there."""

969,"(IraqiNews.com) On Monday several Members of Parliament from Diwaniyah Province confirmed that ISIS killed over 300 soldiers using chlorine gas for the first time in Saqlawiyah, north of Fallujah.

MP Ali al-Badri said, at a press conference at the parliament building in the presence of a number of deputies of Diwaniyah province and attended by IraqiNews.com that “the terrorist organization ISIS used chlorine gas for the first time in the region of Saqlawiyah after trapping more than 400 troops, resulting in the deaths of many of them due to suffocation while the terrorist gangs detonated car bombs within the brigade headquarters.”

Badri said, “We hold the full responsibility for the fate of the trapped soldiers to the Commanding General of the Armed Forces, Haider Abadi, and the security leaders, especially the Anbar Operations Chief, Lt. Gen. Rashid Flaih, because of the slow measures taken by the Air Force despite frequent appeals for rapid procedures to rescue the soldiers since several days ago.”

Badri added that the “Saqlawiyah crime is considered as the second Speicher Massacre,” stressing that “300 soldiers were killed in the attack.”

971,"Some 219 years ago, founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House. On Thursday, excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes, according to the Boston Globe.

The time capsule, contained in a 5-by-7-inch copper box, is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652. The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855, when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items, including coins from the 1800s, were added to the stash.The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone.

Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records.

Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs' Computer Mouse

It’s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state — and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner. That inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s excavation, according to the Boston Globe.

As luck would have it, another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October. That 100-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. That capsule held sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles.

As for this most recently extracted time capsule, it’s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. On Sunday examiners will X-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week. After that, it will be returned to the State House cornerstone, perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover.

972,"KFC: Marijuana on the menu? Not likely. A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy, but the fact is, there’s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores.

The story began at the Racket Report, where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game. While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop, there are a few problems.

First and foremost, Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website, carrying multiple stories, such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story, that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes. (Here‘s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale.)

KFC also doesn’t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page — a thing you’d think they’d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales.

Another concern is banking. While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks, many report still having difficulties. Though the original story claims that KFC’s pot sales will be cash only, in order to protect the restaurant’s funds, this would be no protection.

If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal (a question that is in limbo at the moment, with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority, but laws still on the books) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected. That is, if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured, they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents — even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash.

This could not only be a concern for KFC, but for its parent company, YUM Brands.

Notably, a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode, and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana — but it’s not the fried chicken chain. Instead, it’s a shop called Kind For Cures, a California pot shop based on that same South Park episode, that assures on its website, “This ain’t no chicken joint!”

Calls to YUM Brands and to KFC Tuesday evening were not immediately returned, but there are no signs that KFC marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon.

974,"London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.

The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.

London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.

“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.

The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.

“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”

After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.

“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.

“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground.”

Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.

“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”

“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”

In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.

As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.

Horner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. For anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London working alongside the United States have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325."
975,"Brian Williams took a moment on Monday’s “NBC Nightly News” to push back on a social media dustup over a Saturday night liveshot that didn’t quite happen. Mike Seidel appeared on camera Saturday night with his back turned, leading some to speculate the reporter may have been relieving himself.

No so, geniuses:

Social Media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel Meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night: Lester Holt threw to Mike’s live report in a snowstorm in North Carolina. Mike had lost cellphone contact with our control room.. so he couldn’t hear through his attached earpiece that he was on the air. He put his back to the storm and the camera.. he had to take off his gloves and re-dial his phone which was tethered to his ear, that’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow. It was just Mike working to make it right — which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel."
977,"Supporters of Islamic State have claimed that an American aid worker held hostage by the militant group has been killed in a Jordanian air strike intended to avenge the burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.

A statement posted on a website sometimes used by Isis fighters and their supporters said that Kayla Mueller, 26, had been killed by a missile strike during a bombing raid by Jordanian planes on the Syrian city of Raqqa early on Friday.

Mueller died when rockets partially destroyed the building in which she was held, the statement said, adding that no Isis fighters were killed in the attack

Several pictures of a damaged building complex were included in the statement which they said showed the aftermath of the air strike, but the claim that Mueller had been killed could not be independently verified.

“The criminal crusader coalition planes targeted sites outside Raqqa city today at noon time while people were performing Friday prayers,” the message read.

“The raids continued on the same site for more than an hour. God has disappointed their endeavours and foiled their plot by not hitting any jihadi man thank God.”

The Isis communique used Mueller’s full name and included her US contact details, which had not been made public by the media at the family’s request.

Last week the militant group prompted outrage around the world when they released a video of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh being burned to death.

In response, Jordan’s King Abdullah vowed to step up his country’s role in the US-led coalition against Isis, promising to wage “relentless war” against the militant group which has taken control of a wide swath of Syria and Iraq.

Jordan announced that it sent tens of fighter jets to hit Isis targets in Syria on Thursday, including what they claimed were ammunition depots and training camps. Jordanian jets carried out a second wave of air strikes against Isis targets on Friday.

Jordanian officials seemed to cast doubt on the reports of Mueller’s death. Foreign affairs minister Naser Judeh, said on Twitter: “An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.”

State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said she could not confirm the report, but said that “a number of Americans” were being held by Isis.

Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said: “We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports.”

“We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil’s claim,” she said, using another acronym for the group.

Mueller, originally from Prescott, Arizona, was seized by Isis fighters in August 2013 as she left a hospital run by the Spanish branch of Medecins San Frontieres in Aleppo.

The aid worker had traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border in December 2012 to work with groups providing support to Syrian refugees, a family spokesperson said in a statement.

She had spent the previous four years working for various aid groups in India, Israel and Palestine.

An unaffiliated citizens group in Raqqa who have proved reliable in the past told the Guardian they believed the claims of Mueller’s death were true, based on comments by Isis fighters.

But given the extent of the damage to the building complex shown in the statement, it is unclear how other Isis fighters could have escaped alive unless the hostage had been left unguarded.

Unusually for Isis, the militants did not provide footage or photographic evidence of Mueller’s purported death as it has done with previous hostages.

Over the past seven months, Isis has killed three American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. All three men were on camera, and video of their killings was posted online.

Two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, were killed in December, as were two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

John Cantle, a British journalist, is believed to still be in Isis captivity. Cantle has appeared in several Isis propaganda videos, the last of which was disseminated online in early January.

A second female western hostage is believed to remain in the hands of Isis militants in Syria. In contrast to the nine male hostages and Kasasbeh, neither Mueller nor the second female hostage have ever been shown on camera or in propaganda imagery distributed by the group.

Isis is believed to have previously released misleading reports on the fate of their captives. The group maintained that Kasasbeh was still alive throughout a prolonged – and eventually fruitless – attempt to negotiate a prisoner swap involving the two Japanese hostages and Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber who had been on death row in Jordan since 2008.

The group’s media outlets released the video of Kasasbeh’s death on Tuesday, but Jordanian officials belief that he had been killed about a month earlier. Rishawi was hanged on Wednesday, hours after the video was released.

Mueller, who graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, had long made helping others a priority, according to the Mueller family spokesperson, who cited years of social welfare activities at home and abroad.

In a story in her hometown paper, the Prescott Daily Courrier, Mueller said she felt drawn to help after learning more about the situation in war-torn Syria.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. [I will not let this be] something we just accept,” Mueller said. “It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”"
978,"According to a news source from Taiwan, the mass production stage of the Apple Watch will not begin until January.
In addition to the delay in start of mass production, the G for Games blog also reported that the Apple Watch will instead be assembled by only one supplier, as opposed to the two suppliers that was previously rumored.
The information about the January start of mass production was revealed [in Chinese] by AppleDaily, which adds that the reported time frame of the start of mass production will make questionable Apple's statements that the Apple Watch will become available to the public by early 2015.
The Apple Watch was unveiled by Apple on Sept. 9, in the same event where the company unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The device is Apple's first entry into the wearable technology market, wherein rivals such as Samsung and LG and startup companies such as Pebble have already established their presence.
In the event, Apple said that the Apple Watch will begin to be sold to the public in early 2015 without specifying a definite time frame. However, if Apple really does intend to release the device early next year, mass production should already have started.
AppleDaily's report of a January start date for the Apple Watch's mass production could mean that the delay was due to the suppliers that Apple tapped for the device.
Earlier rumors suggested that two suppliers will be assembling the Apple Watch, namely Quanta Computer and Inventec. However, AppleDaily's report specifies that Quanta will be the only supplier to Apple for the device, with Inventec being removed from the process due to reasons that have not been made clear.
Quanta has started its preparations for the mass production of the Apple Watch, increasing its workforce to a total of 4 million employees, reported G for Games. There is also said to be an agreement between Apple and Quanta that the Chinese supplier will not be manufacturing smartwatches for Apple's rival companies in the industry.
The delayed mass production start, coupled with the sudden departure of a supplier, will make it difficult for Apple to keep its promise of an early-2015 release for the Apple Watch.
The delay will only add to the conservative expectations that Piper Jaffray investment firm analyst Gene Munster has on the sales forecasts for the Apple Watch.
""Overall, we believe that the Apple Watch is light years ahead of any other smartwatch on the market, but consumer application may be limited initially until developers begin to create useful applications for the watch,"" Munster wrote. 
Munster forecasts 10 million Apple Watches sold in 2015, with a selling price of an average of $500."
979,"Celebrity Dog Cesar Millan should have died, according to a post on the site noticiasunam.com. But there are many obvious oddities in the post - Viral Inspector shows why it probably is fake.

TV Personality and hunduppfostraren Cesar Millan has died of a heart attack, reports the site noticiasunam.com . The news has been widely adopted - just over 17,000 interactions on Facebook accordance sharedcount.com - and shocked many. ""Oh, becomes so sad. Rest in paradise Cesar Millan! ""Writes one of many Swedes who have turned to Facebook to express their condolences.

But they probably unnecessarily. It is unclear what exactly noticiasumam.com is a kind side, but a reputable news source, it is at least not.

To begin with, there are many warning signs about the article itself if Millan's death. It is the Hispanic-side single article in English, and has under its byline written by Frank William Abagnale, a famous forger of checks whose lives laid the basis for the movie ""Catch Me If You Can"". And whatever Abagnale do nowadays so it's probably not writing for noticiasumam.com.

Additionally, it stated the source of the claim to be a press conference with Millan's wife, Jahira Dar. Searches shows that this press conference is not mentioned anywhere else than right on noticiasumam.com, which almost certainly means that the conference never even took place. To make doubly sure is Jahira Dar and Cesar Millan not actually married, at least according to a mingling article in the Daily Mail from November 23. 

According to the article, Millan have been put in the hospital ""yesterday afternoon"", ie on Tuesday. But the night of Wednesday, Swedish time appeared still up happy tweets and status updates on Millans Twitter - and Facebook feeds  - the last came as late as an hour before the site's article was published. Cesar Millan has a television program on the National Geographic, nor where there any information about his death.

If there are rumors about a celebrity death so you should always wait until they are confirmed by a close relative or associate of the person, in an interview with a credible source. In the case of Millan, there is no such confirmed data, and both Indian International Business Times  as Dutch De Telegraaf  warns that page that published the news is not credible.

Viral reviewer can therefore conclude that the source of the allegation of Cesar Millan's death is not credible. Although Millan's team have not directly denied the information we dare say he most certainly not dead. We have searched his team for comment."
981,"The Pentagon confirmed today that the U.S. killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the al-Shabaab insurgent group in Somalia, in an airstrike this week.

U.S. special operations forces targeted Godane in southern Somalia in a Sept. 1 attack using manned aircraft and drones to destroy an encampment and a vehicle. It took several days to confirm initial reports that he died in the attack.

“The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement confirming the mission’s success.

Al-Shabaab, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 2008. Godane claimed responsibility for the attack last year on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya’s capital of Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died. The U.S. has offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.
Godane was among a number of “high-ranking” al-Shabaab officials who were meeting at Dhaytubako, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred, Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said in a phone interview Sept. 2.

Suicide Bombings

In recent months, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Djibouti that killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western soldiers as well a car bomb at the Mogadishu airport that targeted and killed members of a United Nations convoy, according to the statement.

Al-Shabaab was responsible for twin suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, that killed more than 70 people, including one American. The group has also been responsible for the assassination of Somali peace activists, international aid workers, numerous civil society figures, and journalists.

(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico.

It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.

Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.

Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them.

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.

The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search.

""Help us find them!"" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.

State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.

The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention.

But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough.

""NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,"" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.

""The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,"" one student from the school told CNN en Español.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.

""To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,"" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. ""It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us.""

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.

Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Español.

""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"" he said. ""It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.""

The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door.

""Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,"" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez.

When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again.

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.

Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday.

In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

For years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation.

Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.

986,"Prepare to meet ... mite man.

Doctors removed a matchhead-sized insect, believed to be a spider, from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is.

It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest, leaving a trail of red blisters.

The 21-year-old was on his first trip to Bali.

He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin.

There’s just one problem.

Spiders, according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau, don’t burrow in skin.

“They don’t have the tools, the armature, to do this sort of stuff,” Dr Framenau said.

“I find it highly unlikely, almost impossible, that it was a spider.’

More likely, Dr Framenau said, was some kind of burrowing mite.

“That’s a professional skin-digger,” he said.

“There’s a lot of nasty stuff out there.”

The results of the tests on the creature should come back next week.

989,"Industry sources indicate Apple is planning to lean heavily on Samsung as a component supplier for both new iPhone 6 builds and the upcoming Apple Watch, reports BusinessKorea (via G for Games). If true, this would be a marked change from Apple's reported goal of lessening its reliance on Samsung by seeking alternative suppliers for critical hardware components.

According to the report, Apple is looking to Samsung to supply RAM, NAND flash storage, and batteries for future iPhone 6 production, supplementing or replacing current suppliers for those components.

NAND flash has been a particular area of concern for Apple according to recent news reports, with the company's decision to use cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models being blamed for sporadic crashing issues. Apple has reportedly moved to stop the use of its current TLC NAND flash chips and supposedly is back at the negotiating table with the South Korean supplier.At first, Apple discussed with Samsung about the supply of NAND flash for the iPhone 6. Due to problems with prices, Toshiba's TLC NAND flash was used in the 128GB models, and components made by SK Hynix, Toshiba, and SanDisk were used in the 64GB models.

However, as overseas IT news sites reported functional defects in the 128GB models, Apple is said to be considering whether or not to replace the TLC NAND flash made by Toshiba with Samsung's own TLC NAND flash. If Apple and Samsung strike a deal, Samsung will supply both DRAM and NAND flash to the iPhone 6.Beyond the iPhone 6, the same Korean industry sources also claim Samsung will supply Apple with application processors for the Apple Watch, which is slated to debut in early 2015.

Apple touts the Apple Watch as using a new ""S1"" module for the internals that seals nearly all of the internal components into a single resin-filled package for durability. The individual components of the S1 are undoubtedly being provided by several different manufacturers, but according to today's report the main application processor portion will be coming from Samsung.

991,"Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.
A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American

The video entitled “Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” purporting to show “James Wright Foley” on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.


At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”
Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.
The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.
The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.
Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant’s advance.
“We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.
An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.
British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities.
The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis’s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group’s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.
The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.
AQI’s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.
Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support – financed by the West – in fighting the jihadi group.
The core of AQI’s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.
Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.
With Isis’ declaration of a “caliphate” in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.
Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis’ attack planning against the West.
Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad’s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states."

Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.

The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.

Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan’s favourite charities after the blunder.

Red-faced bosses, though, didn’t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.

Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: “I felt pure elation and just couldn’t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.

“I can’t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.”

Stan, who was married to Ruby for 20 years, often used to listen to the voicemail when he was feeling down.

He had previously tried to record the message to ensure it wasn’t lost but said: “All I ended up with were blank tapes.”

Virgin is planning to send a CD of the recording to Stan and the grateful pensioner has a treat for the engineer who finally retrieved the message.

997,"The British Islamic State militant known as ""Jihadi John"" believed to be responsible for multiple executions of Western hostages has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi by a report in The Washington Post.

Born in Kuwait, Emwazi comes from a ""well-to-do family"" in West London and studied computer science at the University of Westminster.

The Post talked to multiple friends of Emwazi's who identified him as the jihadist militant responsible for the graphic beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and others. Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the media.

Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, once in Tanzania and again in Britain. This first detention frustrated Emwazi, according to one friend, who said, ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated."" When it happened again, the friend said, Emwazi wrote to the friend that he felt ""like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.""

Emwazi is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012, where he became responsible for guarding prisoners for Islamic State, the militant Jihadist group also known as ISIS or ISIL that now controls large swathes of the country and Iraq. The BBC reports that British security services have previously chosen not to disclose Emwazi's name for ""operational reasons."""
999,"Actor Seth Rogen, famous for comedic roles in hits like ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up,"" will reportedly appear in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic written by Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin, and is set to take on the role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

Rogen's role in the highly anticipated Sony production was revealed on Thursday by film industry publication Variety. Rogen will star opposite Christian Bale, who will play the role of Steve Jobs.

The project has attracted top-level talent, as it will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Sorkin won his Academy Award in 2011 for ""The Social Network,"" while Bale won Best Supporting Actor in 2011 for his performance in ""The Fighter.""

Sorkin's script is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The screenwriter has said the movie will consist of scenes that take place before the unveilings of three key products: the original Mac, NeXT and the iPod.

Wozniak left Apple in early 1987, which would put him at the company for just the launch of the original Mac. But Sorkin's films are not known to stick closely to historical facts, as seen in his depiction of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network."" Sorkin himself has said the film will be more akin to a painting rather than a photograph.

The upcoming movie will be the second attempt at a Steve Jobs feature after indie film ""Jobs,"" the ill-received Ashton Kutcher vehicle released in 2013."
1000,"An animal shelter is trying to track down the owner who abandoned a young Shar Pei at a railway station in Scotland, leaving him leashed to a rail with a suitcase full of his belongings.

The Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), an animal welfare charity, said the wrinkly-faced crossbreed was discovered last Friday at Ayr railway station. His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.

The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog’s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai’s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.

His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.

If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland’s Animal Health and Welfare Act.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said the case highlights the unfortunate consequences of selling an animal online.

“Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,” he said “If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.”

The Scottish SPCA said Kai is a “lovely dog with a nice nature”, and estimate that he is between two to three years old. The charity said it will care for the dog until they find him a permanent home.

Ben Supple, a spokesman with the charity, told the Guardian on Tuesday afternoon that the prospect of Kai finding a loving home looks promising.

“We haven’t as yet found a home for Kai though we’ve been inundated with offers and will ensure we find him the right owner,” Supple said.

Anyone with information about Kai is urged to contact the charity’s animal helpline at 03000 999 999."
1001,"South Korea newspaper claims Kim fractured both ankles

Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since 3 September, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”

“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""

1002,"Seth Rogen is in early talks to play the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in a high profile biopic of Steve Jobs, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Christian Bale is in line to play Jobs himself, the famed technology guru who died on 5 October 2011 of cancer. The Oscar-winning writer of Facebook movie The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin, is writing the screenplay for Britain’s Danny Boyle to direct.

Rogen’s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal, especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line. The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare, and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic.

Sorkin’s take is effectively the “official” Jobs biopic, since it adapts the bestselling official biography of the technology icon, Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography. Isaacson’s book is based on more than 40 interviews with its subject conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues.A rival biopic, titled Jobs, was released in 2013 with Ashton Kutcher as the Apple founder and Josh Gad as Wozniak.

But yesterday, rumors began flying anew in the Cuban-American community -- and, of course, on Twitter -- that the Cuban leader has finally bitten the dust and that a possible news conference will announce his demise today. Could the speculation finally be true this time?

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes ""suspiciously close"" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

1004,"(CNN) -- A woman held by Lebanese authorities is not the wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday, injecting further confusion into an already murky situation.

The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi -- the leader of a self-declared Islamic state spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria -- has spurred intrigue into who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings.

But the Iraqi ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives.

Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture.

Before the Iraqi announcement further muddied the waters, the details surrounding al-Dulaimi and her capture were already pretty fuzzy.

Here are some of the main areas of interest -- and contention.

She's his wife. Or his ex-wife. Or neither.

Regional sources close to the capture told CNN that they are certain that Lebanese forces arrested al-Baghdadi's wife.

But American sources in Washington gave a different view, suggesting the person detained was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.

Intelligence sources had told CNN that the woman's name is Saja al-Dulaimi. But the Iraqi ministry stated bluntly Tuesday, ""There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi.""

It said al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings.

Iraqi intelligence identified al-Baghdadi's wives as Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi.

It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery.

A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was ""married."" CNN was told al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three.

And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of Baghdadi had been arrested.

She wielded power. But how much?

If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is a ""powerful figure"" within ISIS and is ""very active"" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN.

She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN.

But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi.

""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.

Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women.

Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men.

But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women.

She could reveal vital intelligence. Or hardly anything.

The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if indeed it was her, was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN.

The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to ""gain some intelligence"" from al-Dulaimi.

""We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes.

Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though.

Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner.

""We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,"" the unidentified official told the newspaper.

And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date.

""In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,"" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

She was with a son. Or a daughter.

The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports.

An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy.

But Reuters, which originally had reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son.

Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released.

The full picture of who exactly Lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed

1008,"A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation that will change everything you once believed.

The 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

Father John Micheal O’neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 minutes later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston."

CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic. It was allegedly filmed near the shooting scene in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, on Aug. 9.

It was reportedly recorded by a Ferguson resident who could be heard talking with or about a woman while gunfire suddenly erupted in the background.

About six shots in rapid fire could be heard, followed by two seconds of quiet and four additional shots.

“That was what caught my attention initially,” said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. “It shows a point of contemplation.”

CNN said it could not corroborate the tape’s authenticity, and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation.

Six months before he shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown, police Officer Darren Wilson (pictured) earned a commendation for his “extraordinary effort in the line of duty.” Wilson’s father posted these photos to his Facebook page.

Brown, 18, was unarmed when Officer Darren Wilson shot him after stopping the teen for jaywalking. Witnesses have said that after the initial confrontation with the cop, in which at least one round was fired, Brown was walking away with his hands up and was fired at again.

If the audio is verified by investigators, the pause could bolster the witness accounts.

A preliminary autopsy showed that the teenager was struck at least six times, with two bullets hitting his head.

1010,"Islamic State (ISIS) militants claim to have captured a supply bundle dropped by U.S. forces near the northern Syrian town of Kobani. Video posted to a YouTube channel associated with ISIS shows them rifling through packages containing dozens of grenades.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town. However, Kirby said that at least one supply package may have fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

""We are aware that one bundle was destroyed [via a video],"" said Kirby. ""Analysts are working as fast as they can to validate it.""

U.S. forces airdropped a total of 27 bundles containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies early Monday. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities.

Kobani, located just yards from the Turkish border, has been the scene of an intense battle between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants, who attacked the area in late September.

1011,"WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES. A masked militant claims the murder is in retaliation for American airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq. Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.

An American freelance photojournalist missing since being abducted in Syria some 22 months ago was apparently beheaded by an Islamic State militant in a graphic video released Tuesday.

Titled “A Message to America,” the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The family, on its ""Free James Foley"" Facebook page, has yet to confirm his death.

""Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers,"" the statement reads.

Foley, dressed in orange and kneeling in a desert, reads what appears to be a coerced statement that alludes to recent American airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. “My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don’t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family … I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

The militant, speaking English with what appears to a British accent, threatens America and President Obama, directly after Foley finishes speaking.

“So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the man says, gesturing with a knife he then uses to behead Foley.

The clip begins with a video of President Obama announcing Aug. 7. American intervention in Iraq against the militants.

“Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,” Obama said in the clip.

The 40-year-old New Hampshire native has been missing since 2012.

James Foley was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Foley, 40, is a New Hampshire native. He was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Toward the end of the video, the terror group threatens to kill another hostage, Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who has contributed to TIME and has been missing since the middle of last year.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the man says as he holds Soltoff by the neck.

The nearly five-minute clip has since been removed from YouTube. It’s unclear where, exactly, the murder was filmed.

The White House, in a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, confirmed they ""have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley.""

""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,"" the statement reads. ""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deppest condolences to his family and friends.""

In 2002, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was beheaded on video in Pakistan days after being abducted by Al-Qaeda militants.

1013,"Everyone's been waiting years and years for a meaningful update to the MacBook line. According to a report from 9to5 Mac, this will be the year that a new design will arrive. The blog just published a few renderings based on details from unnamed Apple employees. And if they're correct, this new MacBook looks awesome.

The report comes from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, who tends to be a reliable source on all things Apple. The details also match up with many of the rumors about MacBook upgrades in recent years. Chief among them is how Apple will ditch ports almost altogether to achieve a slimmer, sleeker profile. Sources say that prototypes for a new 12-inch MacBook Air are a quarter inch narrower than the current 11-inch model. They also have fewer ports than any other Apple computer: a headphone jack and a single USB Type-C port.

Another less dramatic detail is the slimmer keyboard. Apple's designers are channeling the old 12-inch PowerBook by pushing the keys all the way to the edge. They're also evidently narrowing the amount of space in between the keys to squeeze them together a little bit more. Meanwhile, the trackpad will no longer click in order to make the body thinner. It almost sounds like some sort of feature liquidation, all designed to make this machine as sleek as possible.

It looks pretty amazing, though! If that is what Apple actually does, of course. Click over the 9to5Mac for more on the new laptop design. [9to5Mac]

1014,"A 71 years old cleric Father John Micheal O’neal who was officially dead for more than 48 minutes, was re-started by medics. He claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

Father John Micheal O’neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

However, doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 minutes later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

1015,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Research Medical Center is waiting for test results after concern that a patient might have a contagious disease.  The hospital says some local reports that the patient has Ebola are false.

Research Medical Center says that patient came to its Brookside campus emergency department Saturday for treatment.

“Somebody went to an ER with a high fever and a history of having recently been to Nigeria,” said Jeff Hershberger, the spokesman for the KCMO Health Department.

He says because Ebola is so high-profile right now, they don’t want to rule it out quite yet.

“The patient has been isolated, however, at this point, because there’s been no development of new symptoms, it’s highly unlike that Ebola is the diagnosis,” added Hershberger.

According to a statement from Research Medical Center, like hospitals across the United States, it has standard infectious disease precautions and is well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary.

“There’s a wide umbrella of things that it could be,” Hershberger said, “We want to make sure, looking at that entire umbrella, that we are not ignoring something.”

The hospital does not believe the patient has Ebola, and says the patient is being treated for another illness. Hershberger says regardless, Ebola should not be a big concern.

“It’s very unlikely they will even be exposed to it, let alone contract it,” Hershberger said, “You cannot catch Ebola unless you touch the bodily fluids of somebody who has Ebola.”

The health department says it should know the patient’s diagnosis by Monday. It also says that Research Medical Center is taking the appropriate steps when it comes to dealing with infectious diseases."

1017,"WASHINGTON — A man who scaled a White House fence this month and breached the mansion's front door apparently rushed past a Secret Service agent inside and was stopped only after reaching the building's East Room, a government official confirmed Monday.

New details of the incident involving Omar Gonzalez, who allegedly penetrated the mansion deeper than was previously known, were first reported Monday by The Washington Post.

The government official, who is not authorized to comment publicly about the incident, did not dispute the contents of the Post account.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan, citing an ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the report.

The disclosure comes as Secret Service Director Julia Pierson prepares to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Pierson is likely to address the Gonzalez incident, along with a shooting incident in 2011 which, according to a separate Post report, the Secret Service failed to recognize as an attack on the White House until days after discovering damage left by multiple rounds fired by a high-powered rifle.

In the more recent incident, Gonzalez reportedly overpowered a Secret Service officer and ran through the main floor.

An alarm box near the front entrance apparently had been muted.

Gonzalez, who was armed with a knife, allegedly made it into the East Room before he was taken down by an agent.

The fence-jumping incident and the delayed reporting of the White House shooting in 2011 represent the latest in a series of missteps by the elite protective service.

This year, three agents were sent home from the Netherlands before a presidential trip after one of the agents was discovered intoxicated in a hotel hallway.

He later promised he’d deleted the 23 minute video but had actually sent it around on the app, with it soon making its way on to a porn site in Argentina.

In the video the 16-year-old boy who was wearing a soccer shirt is seen smiling enthusiastically and giving the camera the thumbs up symbol before panning around to show he is having sex with the teacher.

Sandoval had previously faced disciplinary hearings at her school in the city of Santiago del Estero over inappropriate relationships with students.

1020,"YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin decided to give a man named Thomas the money and follow him to see how he spends it. His first stop was a local liquor store but instead of buying alcohol he purchased food that he gave away to others in need.

A homeless man was given a chance, and he touched an awful lot of surprised people.

A viral online video from YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin tells the story of a homeless man named Thomas and his desire to not let his circumstances keep him from being selfless - by using his newfound money to help not himself, but others.

Josh made the video, which has received more than 11 million hits by Wednesday morning, with the idea to give a random homeless person $100 and secretly follow him to see how he spends it.

He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100.

""Oh goodness. Oh no way,"" he says as Josh pulls five $20 bills from his wallet. ""Oh brother, are you sure? I'm starting to tear up over here. That's like incredible.""

Josh reassures him it's totally fine as they hug. Thomas says he never had something like this happen before in his life.

The next part of the video seemed to be expected by many viewers but Thomas surprised them all.

He packed up his stuff and began walking down the road to a liquor store. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol.

He purchased food that he then delivered to other needy people in a nearby park.

Josh appears to tell Thomas what was going on.

""I feel like I owe you an apology,"" Josh said as he reaches to grab Thomas' hand. ""You went to a liquor store earlier —""

""You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?"" Thomas interrupts. ""But there's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing.""

Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.

But Josh wanted to contribute to Thomas's good deeds. He reached into his wallet again and gave him another $100.

""You just touched my heart,"" he told his new friend.

Thomas was stunned again.

""I don't know what to say. Usually I'm pretty talkative,"" he replied.

Thomas explained that he recently quit his job and was caring for his ailing stepfather who ultimately died of cancer. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"" he said. ""You're doing good … you'll bump into good people. That's all there is to it. You're on a different path somehow in life. I can't explain it.""

But Josh is trying to change his path.

He established a fund-raising campaign to help Thomas get a new home and a job.

The fund had a goal of $10,000 but it surpassed $55,000 through Wednesday morning.

""People think I changed his life,"" Josh told TODAY. ""For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""

1022,"A man had his genitals chopped off and thrown into the street by an angry mob in India for allegedly sexually assaulting a young woman.

It happened in Ganganagar in the north-western state of Rajasthan, in graphic scenes captured on video.

According to local authorities, the extreme action was a response to high-profile incidences of sexual attacks in India.

World-wide condemnation greeted the gang-rape of a student on a bus two years ago, which shook the image of the country.

Alleged attacker Suresh Kumar, 40, molested a teenager in a street, but her screams for help alerted a crowd which came to her aid.

Kumar was dragged into a nearby butcher's shop and beaten heavily with sticks for nearly an hour, according to reports. Vigilantes then hacked at his genitals with a meat cleaver, before throwing them into the street.

The incident left Kumar in a critical condition.

A reported witness said the action was intended to send out a message that sexual assault was not tolerated.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

A police spokesman, who called on the attackers to hand themselves in, said: ""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.""

1024,"A 10-year-old member of the ISIS terror group has been reportedly killed while fighting in the Middle East. Going by the name Abu Obadya al-Abassi, ISIS posted a video on YouTube Wednesday announcing his death.

The YouTube video has garnered over 75,000 hits as of Friday morning and depicts photos of the boy, but no tangible confirmation of his demise, according to The Jerusalem Post.

""It should be noted that there is no independent confirmation regarding the authenticity of the clip which was posted on YouTube showing the boy dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons,"" the Post reported.

Those who've watched the clip have expressed ""disgust over the use of children in warfare,"" it continued.

ISIS was formed last year from the group al-Qaida in Iraq and is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They have garnered international attention for their atrocities in Northern Iraq and civil war torn Syria.

Known as the ""Cub of Baghdadi,"" the 10-year-old al-Abassi was a native of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

For its part, Saudi Arabia's top religious official has denounced ISIS, calling them in recent statements enemies of Islam and civilization.

Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh issued the statement in August via the Saudi Press Agency.

""Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on earth, destroying human civilization,"" said al-Sheikh, ""are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims.""

It is believed, though unconfirmed, that both al-Abassi and his father were killed in an airstrike by the United States as fighting continues.

News of the death of the Cub of Baghdadi comes as U.S. forces have launched airstrikes over the city of Kobani, which is located on the Syrian-Turkish border.

""The fight for the town situated near the Turkish frontier has become a major early test for the co-ordinated campaign aimed at degrading and destroying the terror group,"" reported Fox News.

1025,"Apple is reportedly limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing, ruling out certain features in order to ensure battery life is not too heavily drained in the initial model, which could tarnish the high-profile launch.

According to Business Insider, developers working on applications for the new Apple wearable have cautioned that consumers should temper their expectations of what the initial Apple Watch is capable of.

The caution harkens back to the initial iPhone launch, when the App Store did not exist, and only the apps pre-loaded by Apple could be used. While the smartphone ecosystem has dramatically changed since then, and Apple’s App Store has proved a template for a new industry, the Apple Watch looks as though it may mirror this model until capabilities improve.

The primary issue is battery life, and Apple’s continued attempts to increase the time between recharges. Earlier reports suggested that the device would have only four hours of active battery life, and many of the sensor features initially touted to be included have been cut due to inconsistency.

Those sensors that do remain are the source of many of the battery issues, according to Sumit Mehra, CTO of Y Media Labs, an app studio which has been developing content for the Apple Watch.

“Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don’t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it’s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours,” said Mehra in a statement to Business Insider.

Apple has not yet released its WatchKit SDK for developing standalone apps for the Apple Watch, with developers at the moment limited to creating extensions to iPhone apps that will function on the watch. This helps save battery for the wearable, and means apps can run on the iPhone’s superior processor, but also limits Apple Watch apps to notifications, app extensions and presenting summaries of information – essentially limited versions of what the iPhone can already do.

With the expected launch of the Apple Watch less than a week away, and Apple predicting huge numbers of sales for its first ever wearable, consumers might be wise to rethink what the device is going to be capable of, at least for the time being."
1026,"McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

“Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.

McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.

One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”"
1027,"Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.

The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.

Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the ""immediate compliance"" with the development.

But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.

""As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them.""

A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.

On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.

Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00pm and by 6:00pm, the fight was over,"" added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.

Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 50 miles southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.

The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.

Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.

A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday – after the purported deal – while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.

""We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all,"" another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.

""To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags.""

Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.

He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted – an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.

On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.

Mr Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.

""The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00am and serious fighting ensued,"" said Mr Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.

""We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists.""

Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.

The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.

But while Mr Ferrari's fish might set a new record for the biggest ever caught on a line, it is not the heaviest ever hooked - that award goes to catfish which weighed 22st and was 9ft long, and was caught in the Po Delta, reports The Mirror.

In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter.

The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish.

In time honoured tradition, he then posed for a photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.

The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in.

The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is recognisable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth.

The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish including other catfish; the larger ones also eat frogs, mice, rats, and even ducks.

Recently, wels catfish have been spotted in non-native habitats lunging out of the water to grab pigeons on land."
1029,"A woman who claims to be Michael Phelp’s girlfriend has revealed she was born with male genitalia – and says she never told the swimmer.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, who also described her ‘amazing intimacy’ with the athlete, admitted on Facebook that her birth name was David Roy Fitch.

Olympic medallist Michael Phelps is currently in rehab at the moment due to a six-month ban from swimming due to driving under the influence.

The 41-year-old, who is technically ‘intersex’, was born with both male genitalia and a uterus but had neither ovaries nor testicles.

She was technically listed as a boy on her birth certificate at first but was eventually ‘medically diagnosed’ as intersex rather than being male or female in her early teens.

She underwent corrective surgery in her early twenties to remove her penis as well as taking testosterone blockers and changing her name.

However, she reveals that she never told the 29-year-old athlete as it ‘never came up’. She suspects he may now leave her after her public admission.

She wrote in the Facebook post: ‘I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.’

Chandler has uploaded dozens of photographs of the swimmer on her social media pages – as well as links to any story mentioning their relationship.

However, she has posted no pictures showing them together.

She added:’There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.’

She also described her love affair with the swimmer – saying the pair met through dating app Tinder.

Brief Analysis
The claims are nonsense. No such incident has occurred in Texas or anywhere else in the US. The story comes from a dubious 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live that publishes a combination of sensationalized but factual news items and outright fiction disguised as news. The 'Ebola Turkey' story is an example of the latter.

Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

Detailed Analysis

 
Story Claims Texas Turkeys Contaminated With Ebola
According to a story that is flapping vigorously around the interwebs, thousands of holiday turkeys at the Texas Prime Turkey Farm have been contaminated with Ebola. 

The story claims that an Ebola infected worker on the farm contaminated the turkeys. Supposedly, the CDC has confirmed that 3000 of the turkeys have already been tested positive for the virus and that the farm has been ordered to burn all 250,000 turkeys.

The story features a photograph depicting a huge farm shed littered with the bodies of deceased turkeys.

Story Is False - No Such Incident Has Occurred
Thankfully, however, the claims in the story are nonsense.  No such incident has occurred, in Texas or anywhere else.  

The report comes from a trashy 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live.  While the site does include some sensationalized reports on real incidents, it also features stories that are entirely fiction.  The site has the following disclaimer on its Contact page:

1036,"British Intelligence officials have zeroed in on a suspect in the on-camera ISIS murder of American journalist Jim Foley, and he is widely believed to be a slim, light-skinned rapper from London. 

Though the MI5 and MI6 agencies are not releasing the man's name, reports say Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — also known as “Lyricist Jinn” or “L Jinny” — is the main suspect. According to USA Today, he was identified via voice comparisons, and Abdel Bary's music career left them plenty of samples to consider. USA Today reports that U.S. intelligence has not yet been able to confirm the results.

Abdel Bary's father, Adel Abdel Bari, is believed to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden's and was allegedly involved in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. He was extradited to the U.S. in 2012.

The younger Bary's music seems to chart his path to radicalization:

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

 “It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (“roll up and watch the leaves ignite”) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

“It’s true,” an insider confirms to PEOPLE. “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

How did the rodents penetrate the fashion bible’s new office? Radar confirmed what we’ve heard from at least one other source: The rats let themselves in via 1WTC’s ventilation system:

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

1046,"The Weather Channel’s Mike Seidel has taken a lot of ribbing about what he was doing live on network TV this weekend.  But he didn’t do what online news sites and YouTubers suggest he did.



Seidel was reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina Saturday where an early season storm dropped 10 inches of snow. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt introduced Seidel while the meteorologist’s back was turned to the camera. Seidel was hunched over fiddling with something. To an awful lot of people who saw Holt dump out of the live shot, it appeared Seidel was zipping up his pants, having answered nature’s call.


The NY Daily news headline taunted, “NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel appears to relieve himself during broadcast.”

But that is not what happened at all, said Shirley Powell, the Weather Channel’s spokesperson. Seidel, she said, was using his cell phone as an IFB (that is short for interruptible feedback) which is how reporters in the field get their cues from the control room. The phone lost its signal just as the anchor was introducing the live shot. Powell told Poynter.org that Seidel yanked off his gloves, turned from the howling wind and was dialing the IFB when Holt tossed to him. Since Seidel didn’t have a phone signal, he didn’t know he was on the air. While he frantically dialed the phone, Seidel tucked his heavy gloves between his knees to keep them from blowing away. When he finished dialing, he yanked his gloves back on and turned to the camera but Holt was already calling off the shot and moving on. Seidel was left hanging in the winter wind.

“I’m glad for you to tell what really happened,” Powell told me.

The crew was using a LiveU mobile live system, which is a backpack sized phone based transmitter andSeidel would not have had a live truck engineer who might have alerted the control room of the communication problem. We still don’t know why the producer in the control booth took the shot live on the air with Seidel turned away.

On his Weather Channel bio page, Seidel is asked, “What is your most embarrassing moment on the air?”  He answers “Do you want a list?”  Whatever was on that list before now just took a back seat. And sadly for Seidel, the video will live forever online."
1047,"The North Korean leader already has a restaurant in Holland and is hoping to branch out and build diplomatic ties with European cities

Kim Jong-un could try and open a restaurant in Scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup, North Korea experts claim.

This comes after the controversial leader brought his chain, The 'Pyongyang' restaurants, over to Europe by launching one in Holland.

Now North Korea watchers believe Scotland may be the next prime location, largely thanks to the popularity of whisky among the communist ruling elite.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

He added: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts.

Getty   Tasty: Kim Jong-Un is a fan of delicacies such as dog meat soup

""Despite voting No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England.

""Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The chain has begun springing up across China and Asia, with proceeds funnelled back to North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, said: ""They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

""They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

""But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won't get a plateful of dog!""

Reuters   Hungry dictator: Kim Jong Un looking at fast food

Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months.

She said: ""North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.""

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30% of takings back to Pyongyang. But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-un's own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, portly leader Jong-un is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

It's claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished.

The FBI recently accused North Korea of being behind cyber attacks on the US. The regime is thought to be incensed at a film, The Interview, which centres around the fictional assassination of Kim Jong-un.

1048,"Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos, the New York Post reports.

The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service.

The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).

Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: ""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We’re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""

At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.

Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.

1049,"(CNN) -- Paul Revere hasn't stirred up this much anticipation in Boston since his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington.

More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz.

The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston.

When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.

""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Friday. ""(But) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building, it was decided that we'd try to see if we could find it, investigate and see whether the box was still intact.""

Hatchfield spent seven hours Thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it.

""The contents are of concern, but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition,"" Galvin said.

According to Galvin, the box-shaped capsule was placed by the Revolutionary-era duo in 1795, a year when Adams was governor and when construction began on the State House and its iconic dome, which would eventually be overlaid with copper by Revere.

Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure.

""It may contain other stuff, too,"" said Galvin. ""We don't know that yet.""

But we might soon: Galvin, whose office is inside the State House, said the capsule's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week.

For now, it's getting some TLC and a thorough exam -- including X-rays over the weekend -- by the museum's staff.

This is not the first time this capsule was unearthed. In 1855 it was dug up during emergency repairs to the State House and put back in place, something that has Hatchfield ""a little worried.""

""We're a little worried because in 1855, they cleaned the contents with acid,"" she said. ""So we're a little concerned that things maybe deteriorated inside.""

Galvin sounded more optimistic.

""There were some coins that were tossed in the 1855 ceremony in the mix of the mortar. They are in good condition, so we are optimistic that the box itself has withstood the test of time and that it will therefore be holding the contents securely,"" he said.

Galvin told CNN affiliate WBZ the capsule will probably be returned to the State House, and that he's mulling both a new container for the capsule and new items from the current era.

On Monday some news sites reported on a hoax video of a pigeon pooping on Putin during his speech on the dangers of military aggression while unveiling a monument in Moscow commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War One. The Independent has a good explainer on why the video below is fake. 

But if it had been real, the symbolism would have been spot on. During his speech, Putin emphasized a strong belief in promoting peace, even as Russia's policies have only provoked and perpetuated violence in Ukraine and Crimea, which he invaded. Despite his words, Russia announced on Monday that it will hold military exercises on its border with Ukraine in a show of strength, according to Reuters. The ""war games"" will include 100 fighter jets and missile practice. 

According to RT, he called the memorial ""'a tribute to the great deeds,' but also a warning that 'this peace is fragile.'"" He said that ""a peaceful and quiet life"" is the most valuable thing on Earth and that ""humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence. And the way to peace and prosperity is made up of good will and dialogue, and the memory of the lessons of the last wars.""

1053,"Stan Beaton had kept a voicemail from his late wife for 14 years when an upgrade to his phone line caused the recording to be deleted.

Work by Virgin Media caused the message, which was left by Beaton’s wife, Ruby, two years before her death in 2003, to be erased last month, the BBC reported.

The clip was recorded by Ruby to serve as the message people would hear when they called Beaton’s phone.

The 68-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds: “I’ve always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife’s voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that’s why I never changed.

“Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

“In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically, it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

“In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.”

Then, having heard Beaton’s story, a team of 11 engineers decided to try to recover the deleted audio recording.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, told the BBC the task was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

“The chances of its recovery were slim,” he admitted.

But after three days of searching, the team found the message on Friday.

This is Beaton hearing his late wife’s message after it was recovered:

He said afterwards: “It’s just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.”

“I’m staggered at the lengths they have gone to.”

“They’ve made this old-age pensioner extremely happy,” he told the BBC.

Virgin Media is sending Beaton a CD of the recording and the retired forklift truck driver plans on thanking whoever delivers it in style.

“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he told the Huddersfield Examiner.

Following the incident, Virgin pledged to make a series of donations to charities of Beaton’s choice as an apology."
1055,"A Catholic priest from Massachussetts who was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation about God.

According to 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O'neal claims that God is a warm and comforting motherly figure, whom he met in the heaven.

Father John Micheal O'neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like ""Being of Light"".

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O'neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ""Holy Mother""."
1056,"Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.

The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital.

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event.

Bill Cooke, head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT.

NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.

""For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ... despite the population,"" Cooke said. ""So I'm very sceptical.""

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed ""2014 RC,"" which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big, or the size of a house.

'Fascinating event'

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"" Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about ""this fascinating event"" in the Central American nation, one of Latin America's poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected."
1057,"Claim: A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014]

Spider burrowed into WA man's abdomen and lived there for three days while he was on holiday in Bali. Ohhhh My Gawwd!

Origins: On 15 October 2014, social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale. An Australian man named Dylan Thomas quickly became the subject of international buzz (via Facebook) after he asserted that during his vacation trip to Bali, a spider burrowed under his skin and had to be surgically removed. Thomas' frightening spider story was picked up by news outlets in Australia, then Europe, and eventually in the U.S. Images sourced from Thomas' Facebook circulated as well via news outlets on Twitter and Facebook:

Spider burrows through man's appendix scar and crawls under his skin http://t.co/pbNc9kGcjA pic.twitter.com/DVVTvY5NtC— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 16, 2014

Although Thomas' tale spread quite widely, nearly all the initial reports of it stemmed from the same source, an article published by the Australian news site NT News:

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas' first trip to Bali was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.

21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards.

""It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,"" he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

Later that morning he awoke to blisters.

�That's when it became painful, it was a searing burn,� he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan's recent appendix removal.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.

Moreover, all the information contained in that article came from Thomas himself, thus unleashing on the Internet that bane of fact-checkers: the single-source, self-reported, uncorroborated implausible story. And not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnid-based urban legends that have circulated for more than a century, such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin, but the reporting agency (Australian Nothern Territory's NT News) is one akin to America's National Enquirer or Weekly World News : the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly, sensationalized articles such as ""Obama Gets Croc Insurance,"" ""Frog Gets Struck Down by Lightning,"" and ""Best Man Left Bleeding After Being Hit in Eye by Flying Dildo."" (The story has since been published by more staid news sources as well.)

We've found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin, or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible. Christopher Buddle, an associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, addressed Thomas' claim in an e-mail, saying that the story didn't wash with what we know about spider behavior:

I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.

As noted, no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered: no pictures of the skin-invading spider have been presented, no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted, and no witnesses to the spider removal other than Dylan Thomas himself have been referenced.

Perhaps there's a germ of truth to this story that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding, but in the absence of any other evidence we remain extremely skeptical about the tale as presented.

You get revenge.

Scorned wife Ting Su learned her husband, Cheng, was cheating on her so decided to punish him.

Following a mobile phone tracker, Ting Su found her 30-year-old partner naked in a parked car with her own twin.

Realising they had been caught in the act, the pair hopped out of the vehicle completely starkers.

1063,"Apple is planning to release its slimmest MacBook yet, boasting a single USB port and 12-inch display, according to a new report.

Rumours site 9to5Mac created artist renditions of the revamped model based on information from sources within the company, which it says in the first major shakeup of the Mac line since the introduction of the Retina MacBook Pro in 2012.

The 12-inch model would slot neatly into the current range, which is comprised of an 11-inch and 13-inch model. The new version is slimmer than both predecessors, but sports the same 'tapered' design from top to bottom.

But such a slimline frame comes at a price; as Apple appears to have done away with standard USB ports and SD card slot. A single USB Type-C port remains, and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space.

Four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation, as the model has no fan. The trackpad is taller than that of the 11-inch model, and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop, with a notably slimmer margin.

UK pricing and the release date of the potential new model remain unknown.

The first MacBook Air was introduced by former chief executive Steve Jobs at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo, where he claimed the company had built the world's thinnest notebook. The MacBook Air replacing the white MacBook as the standard entry model after its discontinuation in 2011.

The news comes as reports circulate that Apple is preparing for the Apple Watch to go on sale by the end of March.

1064,"DUBAI:  A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied, ""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names. ""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ""snow bride"" wearing a bra and lipstick. ""The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: ""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. ""It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"" one wrote.

""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about,"" said another.

1065,"According to a new survey conducted by analysts at UBS, interest in the smartwatch market is continuing to grow ahead of the Apple Watch launch early next year. Of the 4,000 respondents asked to partake in the survey across four different countries, about 10 percent cited that they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next year. Based on projections of Apple's iPhone sales and the current installed base of iPhones compatible with the Apple Watch, the analysts predict Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches within the first nine months.Figure 10 indicates that 10% of respondents (401 out of 4,000) are very likely and 17% (682 out of 4,000) somewhat likely to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. That is a three-fold increase vis-à-vis the 386 respondents claiming to already own a smartwatch and a four-fold increase if we assume that around one-third of the currently owned smartwatches are actually fitness bands.
Based on an estimate of 240 million iPhones compatible with Apple Watch being in customers' hands by the end of 2015, UBS suggests this could translate to 24 million Apple Watches sold in the first 9-12 months of availability, depending on supplies.

In a smaller survey of customers who registered as very likely to purchase a smart watch, the Apple Watch placed second to the Samsung Gear in buying intentions, although UBS expects those positions to reverse once the Apple Watch becomes available.

The analysts also expect the new Apple wearable to redefine the category much like previous products from the company have done for their respective technological categories. Despite first-version limitations in daily charging and iPhone tethering, UBS sees significant potential for the Apple Watch and predicts it will become the spiritual successor to the iPhone in the long-term.Cellular and battery technology is not yet sufficiently miniaturized to fit in the Watch and allow independent functioning. We would think the ability to do so is maybe five years away. In fact, the screen size differential may mean that the Watch and the iPhone will prove complements rather than substitutes. Arguably that is the way the iPad and Mac might be playing out, different products for different jobs.

Given that about two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables. With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market. The Apple Watch is set to launch in ""early 2015"", reportedly in the ""spring"" according to an internal video from retail chief Angela Ahrendts.

1066,"We still don’t know the exact date the Apple Watch will ship, but a new rumor claims you won’t be able to pick one up at BestBuy, Walmart, or other non-Apple Stores at launch.

Apple plans to make its timepiece an Apple Store exclusive, according to German distribution sources who claim resellers will be shut out so Cupertino can suck up as much Apple Watch profits in the first year as possible.

We can’t verify the sources, so the rumor should be taken with some healthy skepticism, however, we’ve already heard rumblings that Apple is redesigning Apple Stores just for the Apple Watch launch. Leaning on Apple Store to provide the best possible sales experience during the introductory year would make sense.

The Online Apple Store will also sell the wearable. Vaults will supposedly be added to Apple Stores to keep the pricey gold Apple Watches secure. Stores will also have glass viewing cases for the expensive models. Customers will be able to ask specialists to try the different models on, while smaller tables are also supposedly planned so that the Apple Watch Sport and others are better staged.

Apple most likely wants to keep the selling experience on its terms until people are more familiar with what an Apple Watch is. The iPhone was exclusively available at Apple Stores and carriers before distribution deals were later struck with Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.

Tim Cook revealed the Apple Watch will ship in April. The exact pricing for Apple Watch an Edition models, as well as launch details, are expected to be announced at an event in March."
1068,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua’s government said Sunday that a mysterious boom heard overnight in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua’s airport.

A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a committee that studied the meteorite found that it “appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.”

The resulting crater had a radius of 39 feet and was 16 feet deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was not clear if the meteorite had disintegrated or been buried.

Residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday night, but said they did not see anything strange. “I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing. Then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,” Jorge Santamaria said. “We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.”

Humberto Garcia of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua said an asteroid had been forecast to pass by on Saturday. As for the meteorite, he said, “We have to study it more, because it could be ice or rock.”"
1069,"There were conflicting reports about the outcome of the operation

A British-born photojournalist has reportedly been killed by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces.

Luke Somers, 33, had been held hostage since being kidnapped in the capital, Sana’a, in September 2013 as he left a supermarket.

There were conflicting reports on Saturday morning about the outcome of a joint US-Yemeni operation to free him. Some said an unnamed American hostage had been rescued while others said Mr Somers was dead.

His captors had taunted his family after a previous attempt by American and Yemeni forces to free him, saying on Thursday they would execute him within three days if the US did not meet their demands.

Al-Qaeda released a video statement from Mr Somers, where he said: “I’m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I’m certain that my life is in danger.""

Lucy Somers, his sister, told the Associated Press today that FBI agents informed her he was killed in another failed rescue mission but Washington has not confirmed the claim.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said.

She had released a video pleading with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to let him live, describing her older brother as a romantic who ""always believes the best in people"".

Mr Somers’ father, Michael, called his son ""a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"" and asked for his safe release and his mother and brother appealed to his captors to spare him, saying he ""was only trying to do good"".

According to a statement on the website of Yemen's defence ministry, a hostage rescue attempt on Saturday morning was successful.

A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists. It was unclear whether the hostage described was Mr Somers.

No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location.

Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there.

The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil.

Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers.

American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country.

Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.

The Pentagon has not replied to The Independent's request for confirmation.

1070,"GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down. 

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering. 

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip. 





The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area. 

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."

The incident comes just a day after police killed a Muslim convert in Quebec after he had hit two soldiers with his car.

From the Associated Press:

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Police say a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial has been by an unknown gunman.

Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. Wednesday with a report of shots fired, and witnesses reported seeing a gunman running toward Parliament Hill, which is under lockdown. Others on the Hill told Canadian Press they heard shots being fired in several different corridors.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

Emergency responders are still on the scene and paramedics took the wounded soldier away in an ambulance.

The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over - and one of them killed - in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies."
1073,"A small meteorite landed near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, on Saturday night, government officials say.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling the impact, which left a crater 12m (40ft) wide and 5m deep.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said the meteorite seemed to have broken off an asteroid which was passing close to Earth.

She said international experts had been called in to investigate further.

No-one was hurt when it hit the wooded area near the international airport and an air force base.

'Like a bomb'

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was ""convinced it was a meteorite"" which caused the impact.

Experts studying the crater said it was not clear whether the meteorite had disintegrated upon impact or had been blasted into soil.

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time and reported a burning smell.

""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told Associated Press news agency.

Asteroid link?

Ineter scientist Jose Millan said that ""we need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population"".

Managua, which has more than a million inhabitants is densely populated.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" he said.

""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"" he added.

Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could have broken off from the 2014RC asteroid which passed Earth at the same time.

2014RC, which is the size of a house, came closest to earth at 18:18 GMT on Sunday, when it passed over New Zealand at a distance of about 40,000km (25,000 miles).

The asteroid was first discovered on 31 August and, at its closest approach, was about one-tenth of the distance from the centre of Earth to the Moon, Nasa said in a statement.

It is expected to orbit near Earth again in the future.

In February 2013, a meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids in orbits that pass relatively close to Earth."
1074,"Apple is in negotiations to make the Apple TV a launch destination for HBO's standalone streaming service reportedly called ""HBO Now,"" which could launch in time for the fifth season of Game of Thrones premiering April 12, according to a new report.

Plans to launch a streaming service independent of a cable or satellite subscription have been public knowledge since October. Until now, though, there was no name attached, or any pricing or availability details.

But on Wednesday, a new report from the International Business Times claimed that the service, said to be known as ""HBO Now,"" will cost $15 per month — about as much as viewers would pay a cable company, though providers often force customers to pay for additional bundles if they want HBO.

Apple has allegedly been ""most aggressive"" in trying to secure an Apple TV deal. The set-top box is already one of the homes to HBO Go, which requires an authenticated subscription through cable providers, but it's believed that Apple could add a second app for HBO Now.

HBO's development partner on the service is said to be Major League Baseball Advanced Media. That company is reportedly building both the back-end and the front-end, but with some leeway on its deadlines so HBO executives can be sure the service works at launch.

During last year's season premiere of Game of Thrones, the on-demand HBO Go service collapsed under network traffic. That left some people waiting hours or days before they could stream the fourth season's first episode.

Apart from the Apple TV, HBO Now will likely appear on other platforms where HBO already has a presence, such as Roku and Xbox. It could have a significant impact on the cable and satellite industry, which has leveraged networks like HBO and sports channels to deter people from jumping ship to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu."
1075,"The tale of the Harvard Business School professor who flipped out because he’d been overcharged $4 by a Chinese restaurant took an ugly turn Wednesday night. The Boston Globe’s free Boston.com site, which first reported the story, posted a follow-up claiming that Ben Edelman had sent a racist email to the restaurant owner — and then replaced the follow-up with an “Editor’s Note,” explaining that the authenticity of the email couldn’t be verified. The Boston Herald has a summary of what went wrong.

The original story about Edelman, by Boston.com’s Hilary Sargent, had gone viral. Who, after all, can resist reading about a privileged Harvard professor threatening legal action against a hard-working business owner because the prices on his website hadn’t been updated for a while? So when Boston.com retracted its explosive allegation (carrying Sargent and Roberto Scalese’s bylines) that Edelman was not just a contentious jerk but a racist, Twitter exploded.


So what did Boston.com publish? It wasn’t long before screen grabs started to make their way around the intertubes. J. Alain Ferry posted a copy here. What happened was that after Edelman apologized to Ran Duan, whose family owns the Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline, someone claiming to be Edelman sent another email to the restaurant owner, writing, “You may have won the battle Duan, but at least we can agree your menu is a little less slanty-eyed.” That’s followed up by an apology for accidentally sending what was meant as a private joke, which has the effect of making the mail seem more authentic.

Edelman’s domain name, benedelman.org, is easily found on the Web, and it’s not difficult to send an email using any address you like. The Sichuan Garden website offers an email form that lets you do exactly that. One clue is that all of the legitimate emails Boston.com has posted from Edelman are marked as coming from “Ben Edelman,” whereas the racist email and subsequent apology were from “ben@benedelman.org.”

Despite the retraction, Boston.com as of this moment is still all-in on the rest of its Edelman package. We’ll see what, if anything, comes next."
1076,"This post has been updated with additional reporting.

The Islamic State has released a new video in which it brags that it recovered weapons and supplies that the U.S. military intended to deliver to Kurdish fighters, who are locked in a fight with the militants over control of the Syrian border town of Kobane.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist social media accounts, drew attention to the video Tuesday. At one point, it appears to show a masked militant raking his hands through a crate filled with hand grenades.

A U.S. Central Command spokesman said he was looking into the reports. In a news release Monday, U.S. military officials acknowledged launching one airstrike near Kobane that they said destroyed “a U.S. airdrop of Kurdish supplies” to prevent “these supplies from falling into enemy hands.”

“All other resupply bundles were successfully delivered,” the CENTCOM news release said, without specifying what was in the shipment.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that analysts were working to determine what happened. The Defense Department is aware that one bundle didn’t make it into the right hands, and is not sure whether the one that appears in the video is the same one CENTCOM already reported destroying.

On Tuesday, the U.S. military announced another four airstrikes near Kobane, saying it hit Islamic State fighting positions, a building occupied by the militants, and “a large ISIL unit,” using one of the acronyms for the group. The U.S. has launched dozens of airstrikes around Kobane in the last week, as the militants besiege the town.

The incident highlights the difficulty in making sure all airdrops are accurate, even with GPS-guided parachutes that the Air Force commonly uses. Airdrops of food and water to religious minorities trapped on mountain cliffs in northern Iraq in August hit the mark about 80 percent of the time, Pentagon officials said at the time.

The United States began dropping weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and other equipment to fighters defending Kobane on Sunday night, in part because Turkey would not allow Kurdish fighters to cross its borders into Kobane to bolster the town’s defenses. Turkish officials said they changed their mind on Monday, but the deal is tentative and depends on whether separate Kurdish groups can resolve longterm differences to confront the Islamic State.

1079,"Authorities say Bary has a similar accent to the man who beheaded US journalist James Foley.

British rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary has been identified as the killer of American journalist James Foley. Video of Foley’s beheading was released by ISIS last week.
FOX News reported:

American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley’s executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary’s Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with ISIS, the source said.

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as “The Beatles.”

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain’s two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages."

It is believed the injury is a direct result of his excessive weight. The North Korean ruler is believed to weigh over 20 stone, reportedly due to his heavy drinking and an overindulgence in Swiss cheese.

""Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" an anonymous source was quoted as saying in the Chosun Ilbo, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The 31-year-old leader had been absent from the public eye for more than three weeks and missed an important parliamentary session last week, fuelling speculation about his ill health.

In a rare display of honesty about their leader's health, the North Korean government finally confirmed last week that Kim Jong-un was suffering from an ""uncomfortable physical condition"", The Guardian reports.

1084,"The Pentagon said Friday that it had confirmed the death of a key Somali militant leader allied with al-Qaeda who had been targeted in a U.S. airstrike earlier this week.

Ahmed Abdi Godane, a co-founder of a network blamed for its brutal tactics in Somalia and for the attack on an upscale Kenyan shopping mall last year, was killed Monday in an attack carried out by U.S. drones and other aircraft, the Pentagon said.

“Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,” Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.

U.S. military officials had acknowledged that they were trying to kill Godane in Monday’s air assault on a Shabab compound in southern Somalia. But they had been cautious about asserting the mission was successful, mindful of reports of other al-Qaeda leaders who had been killed in drone attacks, only to resurface later.

The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Godane’s arrest. It identified him as a 37-year-old native of northern Somalia who, among other aliases, went by the names Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr and Ahmed Abdi Aw Mohamed.

Monday’s drone strike was the most aggressive U.S. military operation in Somalia in nearly a year, and it came as the Obama administration was already grappling with security crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

Counterterrorism officials and analysts have described Godane as a particularly ruthless jihadi leader who eliminated several rivals within al-Shabab, either by killing them or forcing them to go underground.

It was unclear who might succeed him as leader of the network. Although al-Shabab often posts comments from the group on social media and gives interviews with journalists in Somalia, it has been mum about whether he survived the airstrike."

To fill out the 100 percent fake story, the pranksters write, “Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.” According to a fake quote from a fake police spokesperson, “The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website."
1087,"Russian President Vladimir Putin was pooped on by a bird while giving a speech unveiling a World War One monument in Moscow on Friday. You can see the freedom bombs land at 0:11 into the above video or you can watch it on repeat, forever, in the gif below.

The Moscow bird poop incident of 2014 is a small but symbolically satisfying comeuppance for Putin's involvement in Ukraine, where fighting with Russia-backed separatists has killed hundreds of Ukrainians and, two weeks ago, 298 civilians flying overhead in Malaysian Airlines flight 17. Europe and the US have punished Russia with economic sanctions meant to deter further aggression, but on Friday this unknown bird launched some targeted sanctions against the man himself.

Rn0eaqx

This being Russia, getting pooped on by a bird wasn't even the most ridiculous part of Putin's WWI speech. Putin warned that the lesson of WWI was — fair warning, irony is going to die forever at the end of this sentence — to avoid excessive ambitions in war. ""Humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence,"" said the man whose overt and ongoing support for separatist rebels in Ukraine, which he also invaded to annex Crimea, has helped claim hundreds of lives and stirred up months of crisis.

""It was on the eve of WWI when Russia did everything possible to solve the conflict peacefully, without bloodshed, between Serbia and Austria-Hungary,"" Putin said, repeating an old Russian complaint that only it really wants peace but is ignored by an aggressive West. ""But Russia wasn't heard. And it had to respond to the challenge in order to protect the [fellow] Slavic nation.""

I'm not sure whether Putin means this as an explicit nod to his involvement in Ukraine, but Russia's meddling there has often been internally premised on the idea that Russia must save the Russian-speakers in Ukraine's east. So there would seem to be a parallel. More ironically, the Ukrainians who are fighting and dying to keep Putin out of their country are themselves Slavic, but must have forgotten to thank Putin for his peace-seeking, pan-Slavic magnanimity."

Witnesses in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, say the gunman then ran into the main Parliament building, where dozens of shots were fired.

Ottawa Police say ""a male suspect has been confirmed deceased."" It's unclear whether that suspect was killed at the Parliament building.

During a press conference, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said this is still an ""ongoing investigation"" and asked ""people to stay away from [Ottawa's] downtown core.""

Bordeleau was asked if police are still looking for another suspect, but he would only say that authorities are sweeping Parliament Hill to make sure it is safe.

This hour, Parliament remains locked down.

Update at 1:34 p.m. ET. U.S. In Close Touch:

During his regularly scheduled press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama has been briefed on the matter in Ottawa and will at some point talk to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Earnest said Canada is one of the United States' ""closest friends and allies,"" and administration officials have been in touch to offer any support.

Earnest was asked if this was a terrorist attack, and he said he was not in ""a position to render judgement on that at this point.""

Update at 1:33 p.m. ET. Multiple Shots Heard:

CNN interviewed Peter Henderson, who said he was locking his bicycle near the memorial when the initial shooting took place.

""I heard four shots, turned around and saw the soldier laying on the ground,"" Henderson said.

""People fled Parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, witnesses told the Canadian Press news agency,"" The Associated Press relays.

The CBC reports that ""Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed two people have been taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, one with a gunshot wound."" Reuters quotes Canadian television as saying that Prime Minister Stephen Harper is safe.

The National War Memorial is located in the heart of the Canadian capital near the Parliament buildings.

CBC says:

Josh Wingrove, a reporter on Parliament Hill with The Globe and Mail, tweets:

The incident comes after the country raised its terror threat level from low to medium and two days after two Canadian soldiers were run down — one of them killed — in Quebec by a man who reportedly had jihadist sympathies.

1093,"The terrorist group ISIS has allegedly beheaded American journalist James Wright Foley on video in Iraq in order to send a message to the United States. I'm not going to dignify the terrorists by posting the video here, you can look it up on your own if you'd like. A warning, extremely violent and difficult to watch. 

Wright's fellow journalist Ihan Tanir gave some background on the situation on Twitter.

More from Noah Rothman:

The American photojournalist James Wright Foley was working for Agence France Presse when he was captured crossing the Syria-Turkish border in 2012. The American war reporter had previously been held for six weeks by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya while covering that conflict. Some believed that his capture would be similarly short-lived. Tragically, that would not be the case.

“On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” the FBI noted in November, 2012. “Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.”
Swift justice is in order. Immediately. May his family find peace in this extremely difficult time. 

Meanwhile the JV terror team, I mean ISIS, is threatening to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff next.

1094,"On Saturday, the entire Internet watched in horror and then cautious joy as a drunk and/or high man in the Dallas-Forth Worth airport assaulted a random bystander he believed was gay. The attacker was then quickly subdued by a crowd of people. The video, first posted by Raw Story, has been viewed nearly two million times. But only one person, comedian and friend of Jezebel Sarah Benincasa, noticed that one of the guys tackling said gay-basher looks a lot like actor and decent-seeming human being Paul Rudd.

Here's the video once again, via Raw Story:



As you can see, the glassy-eyed gentleman attacks the guy in the pink shirt because he suspects him of being ""a queer"" and then, when asked why he did that, screams ""Because America!"" (It's great that a crowd of people worked to subdue him; slightly less great that an airport security guard can be seen meandering past him moments before he attacks the pink-shirted man, ignoring him as he screams threats and takes his sweatshirt off.)

In her viewing of the video, Benincasa noticed that around 1:30, one of the people dog-piling the man really, really looks like Paul Rudd. Like, a lot:

As Wonkette reported, another Twitter user, @msigs, found a girl who'd tweeted about seeing Paul Rudd that day, and got her to confirm he was wearing what he had on the video: a checked shirt and a sport coat.


However, that Twitter user appears to have seen Rudd on a flight out of Savannah, Georgia, and we don't know for sure that he stopped in Dallas. (Do people with Paul Rudd-level money really have layovers?)

So, the jury is still out on this one, even as the glorious #PaulRuddSavesLives hashtag is engulfing Twitter. But, if confirmed, it's going to be almost as great — and, let's be frank, arousing — as that time Ryan Gosling broke up a street fight.

1097,"Islamic State has released a video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines.

It comes just hours after his family issued a public plea for his captors to contact them.

The Foreign Office said it was ""working urgently to verify"" the video and offering Mr Haines's family support.

David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said: ""The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.""

He added: ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

Mr Haines, 44, was kidnapped last year as he delivered humanitarian aid in Syria.

His whereabouts were only revealed this month when he was shown kneeling in the sand, wearing an orange jumpsuit, in a video produced by jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which also showed the murder of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist.

A masked man, who has become known as “Jihadi John”, said Mr Haines would be next if the West did not halt operations against Isil.

In the latest video, he is also wearing a orange jumpsuit and is kneeling on the sand.

It begins with a clip from David Cameron. A man believed to be Mr Haines then looks into the camera and says: ""My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to delcare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend against our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans.

""Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions.""

Twitter: David Cameron - The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.

Twitter: David Cameron - We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.

In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth said: ""We are aware of the video.

""We are working urgently to verify the content. If true, this is another disgusting murder. We are offering the family every support possible.

""They have asked to be left alone at this time.""

Mr Cameron rushed back to Downing Street for crisis talks with his advisers, officials and intelligence chiefs on Saturday night. He arrived at No 10 just after midnight.

He chaired a COBRA meeting on Sunday morning.

In the Haines family’s short statement - which was released earlier on Saturday by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - the British captive’s relatives said: “We are the family of David Haines.

“We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply.We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

No further details of their messages were released.

Mr Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was travelling in a car through northern Syria in March last year when he was abducted along with an Italian colleague, who was later released. He was working for a French aid organisation, Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development (Acted).

Mr Haines is believed to have been kidnapped by a gang which later sold him on to Isil.

His identity remained a closely guarded secret for 19 months in a bid to increase the chances of a negotiated release.

But the situation changed dramatically with the execution first of James Foley, another American journalist, and then Mr Sotloff with the subsequent appearance of Mr Haines in the second murder video.

MPs reacted with horror and anger to the reports on Saturday night.

Ed Vaizey, a government minister and Conservative MP, said he was “so sad and angry” to hear reports of Mr Haines’s murder.

Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and shadow minister, said she was “shocked and horrified” to see reports that Mr Haines had been killed. “Hoping mistaken but fear not,” she said.

Dan Jarvis, another senior Labour MP, said he was “sickened”.

Tim Farron, President of the Liberal Democrats, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with David Haines' family and friends tonight.”

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: “I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.

“He was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.

“That ISIL would choose to kill him says everything about their warped logic and murderous ways.

“Acts like this will not weaken but strengthen the resolve of Britain and the international community to defeat ISIL and their ideology.

“My deepest condolences and thoughts are with his family as they cope with this terrible crime. And the hearts of the British people will go out to them.”

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the UK should respond by playing its role in the assault against IS promised by US president Barack Obama.

""What we absolutely need to do is not be cowed in any way by yet another foul murder of a hostage,"" he told Sky News.

""But to develop the strategy into a sensible military campaign in coalition with regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the area.

""We can support them to confront, attack and defeat the Islamic State jihadi fighters ... and make sure this cancer is removed from the region before it spreads more widely.""

The United States also ""strongly condemned"" the killing.

In a statement, the White House said: ""Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve.

""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world."""
1098,"Samsung has won the orders to produce Apple's S1 system-in-a-package for the Apple Watch, reports DigiTimes. The S1 produced by Samsung will combine multiple components including the processor, mobile DRAM, NAND flash, and other chips into one package.

A report in November shared similar information, noting that Apple would be relying heavily on Samsung for iPhone 6 and Apple Watch components. Namely, Apple was said to be concerned about NAND flash, with its cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models said to be the source of crashing issues. Those issues, along with Samsung's competitive prices, were said to be the primary reasons in bringing Apple back to negotiations with the South Korean company.

Apple is said to be targeting a March launch for the Apple Watch, as the company is said to be refining the device's ""Watch OS"" software and working on hardware components like the inductive charging mechanism. Apple Retail Store workers are also set to begin training during the week of February 9 ahead of the device's launch the following month.

As previously described in rumors, the next MacBook Air will have roughly the same footprint as the current 11-inch model, but include a 12-inch display nestled inside narrower bezels. The machine's keyboard will also extend from edge to edge while the speakers move to a set of grilles above the keyboard.

Comparison of 12-inch Retina MacBook Air (left) with current 11-inch MacBook Air (right)
As part of Apple's effort to reduce the thickness of the MacBook Air, the new 12-inch model will do away with nearly all of the ports currently found on the machine, including the usual USB and MagSafe ports. Instead, the machine's sides will include only a headphone jack, a pair of microphones, and a USB Type-C port that appears set to handle both connectivity and charging.

Apple's new Retina MacBook Air is expected to run on new Broadwell Core M to allow for the thin, fanless design and perhaps come in multiple color options similar to the company's iPhone and iPad lineups. The machine has been rumored to be entering production as soon as this month, although it is unclear whether Apple may wait until its Worldwide Developers Conference in June to launch the device or introduce it earlier in the year.

However, the parents of seven different girls are reportedly outraged over the outcome of a recent school trip because all of their daughters came home pregnant! According to The Daily Mail, 28 girls attending a Bosnian school were taken on a five-day school trip from the town of Banja Luka to Bosnia’s capital city, Saravejo. Out of the 28 girls, seven reportedly came home pregnant.

The students were suppose to be touring museums, but apparently, much more went on. Shortly after the trip, the seven girls, who range from ages 13 to 15, all turned up pregnant at the same time and that’s when it was discovered that they all conceived on the trip.

Needless to say, the parents are outraged. As a matter of fact, many of the parents are blaming school administrators and chaperones for lack of supervision on the five-day excursion. However, a Bosnian gynecologist feels otherwise. argues that parents and school officials are equally responsible due to the lack of sexual education children in the receive. According to inserbia.info, Nenad Babici, National Coordinator for the Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school. It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

The shocking report has captured the attention of thousands around the world. The issue has also sparked controversy as many Internet surfers have expressed different views about who should be held accountable for the girls’ actions.

1104,"Spotting a spider on the floor may give you a fright, but imagine finding out one was living under your skin for three days.

This is what happened to Australian man Dylan Thomas who went on vacation to Bali with a friend. His friend noticed a strange red scar going up the 21-year-old's stomach. At first, doctors told him it was an insect bite, but they later discovered a spider had burrowed itself into Thomas's abdomen, most likely through his recent appendix scar.

Thomas posted this on his Facebook page: ""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last three days, managed to get it out luckily. Haven't felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it's all over.""

1106,"KOBANE , Syria, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- There are conflicting reports whether Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman who claims to have joined the fight against the Islamic State, has been captured.
Rosenberg, 31, told Israeli radio she traveled from Israel to Iraq in November to join a Kurdish militia, the only anti-IS group encouraging women to enter combat. IS-affiliated websites claimed over the weekend she was captured near locations where Kurdish and IS forces were engaged in battle, but Kurdish sources told the Jerusalem Post the reports of her capture were merely IS propaganda.

Two messages have appeared on the Facebook social media website since Sunday night, indicating Rosenberg was not taken prisoner. Facebook user Oliver Bruno wrote ""Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause (sic) she has no internet access. ISIS's supporters launched a rumor on social media that she was captured in ‪#‎Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300 km. from Kobani.""

The message would imply Rosenberg left Israel to fight but was some 186 miles away from Kobane, a town on the Syria-Turkey border and the scene of two months of fighting.

A later message from Bruno said the head of the YPG Kurdish forces in Kobane ""categorically refuted these allegations.""

Another message from Facebook user Emanuela Siyar Barzani, citing a ""qualified"" source, noted ""Everything is fine with Gill.""

On Saturday, an online form posted a message from a pro-IS contributor, claiming a ""female Zionist soldier"" was captured in Kobane by IS forces, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. Speculation began that the soldier in question was Rosenberg, but there has been no confirmation.

The Canadian government's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was investigating the reports, but did not confirm Rosenberg, who is from White Rock, B.C., had been captured."
1107,"BEIRUT: A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group's main stronghold.

The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers - which usually take place around midday on Fridays - in airstrikes that targeted ""the same location for more than an hour.""

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed.

It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building - but no images of the woman.

American officials said they were looking into the report, and the White House said it did not have immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government.

The IS statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by IS and was also distributed by IS-affiliated Twitter users.

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she said. ""It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.""

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.

A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. was ""deploying all the assets that we can"" to find Mueller.

""We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today Show. ""Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.""

Her identity had not been disclosed out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after IS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa on Friday. But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday."
1109,"The first group of mass graves excavated on the outskirts of a town in Mexico’s Guerrero state does not contain the bodies of any of the 43 students who went missing last month, Mexico’s attorney general said. The whereabouts of the students, who disappeared after a confrontation with police in late September, have been the subject of mass protests in the state.

Authorities have been conducting DNA tests on the 28 badly burned bodies found in the graves since discovering them earlier this month. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said tests were continuing on four additional graves uncovered last week.

State governor Angel Aguirre said some of the bodies could have been earlier victims of criminal gangs, and some of them seemed to have been buried “months ago.”

Murillo Karam, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, added that 14 additional police officers were arrested over the disappearances. So far, 50 people, mostly police, have been arrested for their roles in the incident, and prosecutors accuse police of colluding with a local gang known as Guerreros Unidos. The police chief and mayor of Iguala, the town where the confrontation between police and students occurred, have also been accused of ties with the gang. Both are currently in hiding.

On Tuesday, the leader of Guerreros Unidos, Benjamin Mondragon, committed suicide by shooting himself when confronted by security forces in the neighboring state of Morelos. Federal authorities said it wasn’t clear whether Mondragon was involved with the student disappearances.

Hundreds of protesters, many from the teachers’ college that the missing students had attended, took to the streets in Guerrero’s capital of Chilpancingo this week over the disappearances. The protests turned chaotic on Tuesday when demonstrators overtook state government buildings, ransacked offices and burned parts of the complex. On Tuesday, they took over bank branches and a local radio station and vowed to keep up the pressure on Guerrero’s government until the missing students were found."
1115,"Militants reportedly have three captured jets and witnesses cited as saying they have seen planes flying low over Aleppo

Islamic State (Isis) is takings its first steps towards building an air force by training pilots to fly captured fighter planes, according to a group monitoring the conflict in Syria.

Isis is using lots of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and Jeeps taken from the Syrian and Iraqi armies but this is the first report that it has planes in the air.

Isis, which took the US by surprise this year with its rapid territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq, has three Russian-built MiG jets, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which appears to have a good network of observers on the ground and has often proved reliable in the past.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the British-based group, said Isis has trainers who had gained experience in the Iraqi air force under former president Saddam Hussein.

Abdulrahman cited witnesses who had seen the planes flying low over Aleppo, in rebel-held northern Syria.

If Isis was able to train pilots, they could mount 9/11-style suicide attacks on key installations in Damascus or Baghdad.

Defence analysts said that while this is feasible, they were extremely sceptical. “There is a small chance but not a big chance,” said Afzal Ashraf, a former RAF captain, counter-terrorism specialist and consultant at the London-based Royal United Services Institute(Rusi).

It was feasible to train pilots for small aircraft but it would be a struggle to do the same with an advanced fighter jet. Such jets would require frequent maintenance as well as a good navigation system and air traffic control, Ashraf said.

Such planes could be easily picked off by US, UK, Turkish or even Syrian planes or air defences. The UK is flying reconnaissance and bombing missions only over Iraq while the US is engaged in both Iraq and Syria.

In February last year, the SOHR reported the capture of the al-Jarrah military airport near Aleppo, which had been held by Assad’s forces. The MiG fighters were said to have been taken at the time.

The monitoring group reported witnesses saying the planes flying low over Aleppo recently appeared to be MiG 21s or MiG 23s and had taken off from and returned to the nearby al-Jarrah base. It added that training courses are taking place at the base.

The SOHR said it did not know whether the planes were armed with missiles.

Isis has taken swathes of Sunni-dominated territory in Iraq and is on the outskirts of Baghdad.

Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorist specialist at Rusi, said he had seen footage of captured planes and questioned their viability. “They were covered in bird shit,” he said.

Pantucci said they would pose no problem for the sophisticated air defence capabilities of the US and its Nato ally Turkey, and even to a lesser extent those of Syria’s President Bashar-al-Assad.

Ashraf said of the former Iraqi air force pilots reported to have joined Isis that it would be hard for them to keep up with the latest advances. “Flying is a very perishable skill,” he said.

He predicted they were almost certain to crash. “You have to be able to fly and to take off and to navigate. If you do not know what you are doing, you are likely to stall it,” Ashraf said."
1116,"The Islamic State militant group claimed Tuesday to have beheaded an American photojournalist in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

A video posted on YouTube, later removed, purported to show the execution of James Foley after he recited a statement in which he called the U.S. government “my real killers.” A second prisoner, said to be Steven Joel Sotloff, like Foley an American journalist who disappeared while covering Syria’s civil war, then appears in the video.

The masked executioner, speaking in English with what sounds like a British accent, identifies Sotloff and says that “the life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

U.S. intelligence officials said they were still evaluating the video and could not immediately authenticate it.

A White House statement said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” one of several acronyms associated with the militants.

“The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,” said the statement by National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Martha’s Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said.

“If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved,” British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter. His office said Wednesday he was cutting short a family vacation and returning to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria.

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

Philip Balboni, GlobalPost’s chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: “On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.”

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

1119,"A British-born photographer held hostage by al Qaida in Yemen has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has said.

Lucy Somers told the Associated Press that she was informed of her brother's death by FBI agents today.

Luke Somers, 33, an American citizen, was captured in the Yemeni capital Sana'a more than a year ago by the extremist Islamic group.

Luke Somers was kidnapped over a year ago by al Qaida (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed)

Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill the hostage if its demands were not met.

Lucy Somers said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""

Last week the US said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages, including Mr Somers, but that he had not been at the site of the raid.

The family of Mr Somers, who was captured in September 2013, had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who ""always believes the best in people."" She added: ""Please let him live.""

His father Michael said Mr Somers was ""a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"".

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English.

He said: ""My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

""It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

""So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.""

Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or ""otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate"".

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

1120,"Pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror group’s hands

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade.

The Pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing. If confirmed, it would be an embarrassment for the US, given the advanced precision technology available to its air force.

The seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of US-supplied weapons being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. “We’re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,” he said. “So I honestly don’t know if that was one of the one dropped.”

The US began dropping munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. “So it’s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,” he said.

“I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we’re only aware of one bundle that did not.”

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to I, it would provide huge leverage for the group, a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Britain has been supplying the Kurdish semi-autonomous region with weapons but so far supplies have been limited. The Kurds report receiving about 40 heavy machine guns but say they badly need heavier equipment, in particular armoured vehicles."
1121,"Kevin Michael Vickers, Canada’s Sergeant-at-Arms, is being hailed as a hero after shooting a Parliament Hill gunman in Ottawa.
Suspected shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau entered the Hall of Honour at around 10 a.m. Wednesday after soldier Nathan Frank Cirillo was fatally shot at the National War Memorial just off Parliament property.
CTV’s Craig Oliver reported Zehaf-Bibeau was carrying a firearm when he walked into the building.

Eyewitnesses describe fear, confusion as gunshots fired in Ottawa
“Kevin Vickers came out of his office carrying a pistol, and apparently saw that he had a better shot, because the gunman had come in his direction,” Oliver reported, relaying a first-hand account from the scene.
Oliver said Vickers unloaded “a lot of shots,” killing Zehaf-Bibeau.
Vickers was a 29-year RCMP veteran when he took the position of director of security operations at the House of Commons in 2005.
As the Sergeant-at-Arms, Vickers is responsible for “safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons” and for “the safety and security of the Parliament buildings and their occupants, ensuring and controlling access to the House of Commons,” according to the government release announcing his appointment in 2006.
The 58-year-old has previously worked as an Aide-de-Camp for the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, and has provided personal security for high-profile visitors like Queen Elizabeth and Prince Andrew.
Vickers has received several commendations throughout his career, including being recognized by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency for ""outstanding contribution to drug enforcement.""
According to Oliver, the security staff at Parliament Hill had been extensively trained for the scenario that unfolded Wednesday.
“They even have rehearsed how to hide behind the marble pillars you see at the top of the stairs and return fire,” he said. “That may have saved a lot of lives today.”
Several Members of Parliament thanked Vickers for his actions, including Justice Minister Peter MacKay and Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino.
“MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,” MP Craig Scott tweeted Wednesday."
1122,"Forget targeted US airstrikes, ISIS faces a new existential threat. Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" and Africa. Mashable further confirms, three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul. For now, it's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus; but it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine.

 

As Mashable reports,

Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance.
 
...
 
""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications told Mashable.
 
Feig added that WHO is in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases, a task that could be a challenge, given the restrictions that would come with operating in ISIS-controlled territory.
 
It's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants' symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.
 
...
 
Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" and Africa.
 
...
 
If the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola — a scenario that, at this point, seems highly unlikely — it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine.
 
Over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, a Middle East-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy.

However, as The International Business Times reports, officials are denying the reports...

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa.
 
Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""
But, perhaps most concerning,

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others.
 
“The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

1123,"The very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan. 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease, allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment: “Zero G Day.” This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places, so I’ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it, hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year’s end. It seems fitting that (hopefully) this is also the last debunking I’ll make in 2014. But who knows? There’s still a week left.

Something you’ll never hear me say: “Well, now I’ve heard it all.”

Long experience has taught me there is always a sillier claim. Always. And you’re hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the Maya calendar predicted the end of the world, that the “Supermoon” caused earthquakes, and that a magnetic pole flip of the Earth will cause superstorms (and another saying the Earth is already physically starting to flip over).

So what’s sillier than these? Well, we now have the claim that early next year—on Jan. 4, 2015 at 09:47 PST to be exact—due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto, you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds (or at least fall more slowly, depending on different “sources”).

It’s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is. First off, this exact same hoax was pulled last year, in 2014, by a site called News Hound (now offline, apparently), and a lot of people fell for it. Here we are again, a year later, back at the same spot. This time the joke is being made by a “news” site called Daily Buzz Live (which didn’t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax). They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event:

There’s only one problem: That picture is completely fake. NASA never tweeted it, and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live. Whoever did it was clever, adding the number of retweets and favorites, but it’s as fake as a $20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City.

After all, the physics of “Zero G Day” is wrong, the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong, and—and this part is the real killer—it’s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago!

Despite this, it’s spreading around Facebook (and Twitter) so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it. That’s why I’m debunking this thing again.

So to get started, here’s the claim:

It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014, an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Yeah, except this is all baloney. To be polite. OK, so why is this wrong?

Pluto and Jupiter, Sitting in a Tree …

First of all, the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally.

And we’re done. Full stop.

OK, fine, I’ll give some brief details. The planets are big objects with lots of gravity, but that only affects you if you’re close to them. Space, however, is big—that’s why we call it space—and planets are far away. This weakens their gravity on you hugely, reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly’s wing.

If you want the math, then here you go: Even if you add all of the planets together, they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon! The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides, too, but that’s even worse: The combined tidal force from the planets is far less, like 0.005 percent of the Moon’s! Simply put, the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you. By the way, the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse, so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks.

Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks.

And specifically, the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all. Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball, far smaller than even our Moon … and at its closest it’s flippin’ 4 billion kilometers (2.5 billion miles) from Earth. That’s a long way. A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does.

In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell ... so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.

Location3

It gets worse (amazingly). The article says Pluto will be “directly behind Jupiter” on Jan. 4, 2015. I checked: On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky. They’re really far apart, about 145°. You couldn’t have picked a much worse date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter.

So the physics of the claim is ridiculous. But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier.

Fool Me Once, Shame on You

The article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from Patrick Moore. He was a real astronomer in the U.K., an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter—he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England.

The wonderful thing about all this is: Moore actually did make this claim! However, as Snopes.com points out, it was an April Fools' Day joke. Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program. To my complete unsurprise, apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect! This is called “priming,” where you tell people in advance that they’ll feel something due to some cause, and they will, even if the cause never happened. It’s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit, to spook people before they actually enter a “haunted house,” guaranteeing they’ll feel chills as they walk from room to room. I’ve seen this myself first hand: People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened.

Hope Floats

So there you go: It’s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place.

I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this. I understand this reaction, but I don’t share it. Smart people fall for silly things all the time, and intelligence isn’t really the prime factor here.

Skepticism is. In general, schools don’t teach people how to analyze a claim, how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it, or how to go about looking into the claim. I knew right away to do the math, and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says. But all too often, people don’t think carefully (or at all) about these claims, and simply spread them through social media. All it takes is literally the click of a “Share” button. Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence, whereas truth must take a harder path.

In fact, that’s why I bother debunking stuff like this. Sure, this is a silly claim, and probably harmless in practice. But not all of them are; I already mentioned the “Mayan Notpocalypse” from 2012, and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism. And of course there are real issues like global warming denial, anti-vaccination, and more, which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public.

In my original post about this in January 2014, I said, “This particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two, but those others are here to stay for a long time.” I was wrong, and I should’ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year; it’s like the “Mars as big as the Moon” nonsense that comes back year after year.

Still, my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of (polite) skepticism into people’s everyday lives, it makes the world a slightly better place to be.

If enough of us do it often enough, we can change “slightly” to “magnificently.”"
1125,"DC Toy Collector is the “highest paid performer” on YouTube making nearly $5 million last year unboxing Disney toys. However, little has been known about the woman-behind-the-hands of the popular YouTube channel. In fact, her face is never shown in the video, only her voice, toys and hands. However, a recent report reveals the true identity of the YouTube hit and the identity is somewhat shocking. A former Brazilian porn star is behind the wholesome Disney videos and it is noted that during the early years of “Disney Collector,” the woman was filming both Disney unboxing videos and porn in the same Florida home.

The Daily Mail reports that Brazilian Daiane DeJeus, also known as Sandy Summers in the porn industry, is the woman behind the hit Disney Collector Youtube videos. Reporters tracked down information on DeJeus that aligns with public records information regarding the widely popular DC Toy Collector YouTube channel. After tracking down DeJeus, the reporters spoke with family and friends who confirmed that Daiane was behind the million dollar videos.

DeJeus has went to unfathomable measures to ensure her identity remained secret and for good reason. The target market of the YouTube channel, which caters to Disney lovers such as children and families, may not remain viewers if they knew the owner’s secret. DeJeus was not only a Disney fanatic, but also a porn star. Going by the name Sandy Summers, Dejeus filmed numerous x-rated videos for the adult film industry in the same home that she filmed some of her early DC Toy Collector features.

Family and friends have identified DeJeus as the mystery unboxer and note that certain physical features on the woman’s hands and arms can be seen in many of the YouTube videos.

“They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.”

Aside from the physical similarities, former neighbors say DeJeus has an unmistakable voice and say that many people on the street knew what she was up to.

‘That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere. Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.”

Would you have ever imagined that the popular DC Toy Collector videos were being filmed in the same house as adult films by a porn star?

1127,"Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages - scattering the creatures and inciting panic

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies.

Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages, which explode on impact - scattering the scorpions and causing panic among the innocent local population.

Although scorpion bombs sound like something out of a modern horror movie, the tactic is actually thousands of years old and was first used by Iraqis fighting against the Roman Empire.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told The Mirror that ISIS had improvised devices to launch the poisonous creatures in 2ft bombs.

He said: 'Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

'Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.'

Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he was advising security forces, said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound 'psychological impact'.

The bizarre biological weapon was used as far back as 198 AD, when Iraqis stuffed live scorpions into ceramic pots and hurled them at Roman armies marching on the fortress city of Hatra.

The Parthian city was held under siege for 20 days by Emperor Septimius Severus before the Roman military were driven out by the 'live grenades'.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies

Adrienne Mayor, a historian of ancient science and classical folklorist, researched the weapon in detail for her 2004 book Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World.

The live grenades were first used by Iraqis in the besieged city of Hatra in 198-199AD.

Soldiers would pack ceramic pots full of live scorpions which they would then hurl at the Romans led by Emperor Septimius Severus.

It is thought that they would first spit on the scorpions to slow them down so they could be handled - although it was still an incredibly risking tactic.

The biological weapon has been credited with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.

She describes how soldiers would spit on the end of the scorpion to calm the creatures before they were packed into pots, which were flung at the besieging Romans.

'It was the brute effectiveness of Hatra's defensive biological and chemical weapons that overcame Roman morale, manpower and siege machines,' she writes. 'The terror effect would be quite impressive.'

Last week, the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane.

ISIS militants have been attacking the Iraqi town of Kobane since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city.

The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane.

Update at 2:30 p.m. from Eva-Marie Ayala: The CareNow is on the Denton County side of Frisco. As the clinic serves those in both both Denton and Collin counties, officials from both will monitoring the situation.

Collin County Judge Ketih Self said he was informed of the situation and understands about 13 people were at the clinic when the patient was there. He said he is uncertain where the patient lived or any other details.

“We don’t know what the situation is just yet,” Self said, noting that law enforcement was at the clinic to help assist.

Update at 2:11 p.m.: The patient, dressed in shorts and wearing a surgical mask and a plastic head covering, just walked out of the facility and into the ambulance, which had been covered in plastic. That patient will likely transported to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where Thomas Eric Duncan was hospitalized.

We are working to determine if this person is among the 48 people the Centers for Disease Control is monitoring. So far there has been no comment from the CDC, which already had a 3 p.m. press conference scheduled.

There are also conflicting reports concerning the patient. Frisco officials earlier said he claimed to have had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, but Care Now says he told them he’d been to Africa.

Update at 2 p.m.: Frisco paramedics, dressed in protective gear, are preparing to transport the patient to a hospital. It’s unclear which one.

Original post at 1:49 p.m.: This just in from Dana Baird, Frisco’s director of communications and media relations:

At 12:32 p.m. today, October 8, Frisco dispatch received a call from Care Now, 301 Main Street, regarding a patient exhibiting signs and symptoms of Ebola. The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas ‘patient zero’. Frisco firefighter-paramedics are in the process of transporting the patient. They are also in the process of examining clinical staff and other facility patrons. That number other people impacted is unknown. No other information is confirmed, available at this time.

1130,"Last week, a heart-warming social experiment video hit the web, showing a ""secretly filmed"" homeless man using an unexpected gift of $100 to buy food for others. Since then, the almost too-perfect clip has been featured everywhere from the L.A. Times to Upworthy and generated over $130,000 on a donation page managed by the video's uploader, YouTube personality Josh Paler Lin.

According to a new eyewitness account, however, homeless star Thomas ""knew he was being followed"" and the ""whole thing is bullshit.""

""Bro, [Lin] drove Thomas to the liquor store,"" 26-year-old Taugan Tan Kadalim told Vocativ, claiming he was on scene when the video's climax, now seen over 28 million times, was shot. ""While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.""

From Vocativ:

The 26-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend, who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street. As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver's seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, it's him,"" says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin's YouTube channel. ""I couldn't believe it.""

A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin's car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.

Of course, given how many of this year's viral videos were hoaxes, staged or otherwise bullshit, it should hardly be surprising that this one might be too. Unlike those videos, however, this one has six figures (purportedly to help Thomas ""get a fresh start"") in questionably controlled donations attached.

When pressed, Lin denied any part of his video had been staged or scripted. ""There is is no way we're making this up,"" Lin told Vocativ. ""This is real."""
1131,"Yes, we've known for a while that Christian Bale might be the next actor to portray Steve Jobs, but Variety now seems mighty sure: the publication is reporting that our favorite Batman will indeed play our favorite technology pitchman in Sony's new movie.

Mind you, Variety technically says that Bale is merely ""in talks,"" but the rest of the article seems pretty certain that it's a done deal.

In case you've forgotten, Sony's film is the one penned by Aaron Sorkinwho also wrote the scripts for The Social Network and Moneyball) is directed by Danny Boyle (remember Slumdog Millionaire?) and is actually based on Walter Issacson's official biography of Steve Jobs. In other words, it's shaping up to be a class act. Maybe it'll be enough to wash away memories of that other Jobs film. [Variety]"
1132,"The value of breaking into the top 100 ranking on the App Store - or higher, really - is fairly well-established (if not a fool-proof way to make a profit).

The same is true whether you’re a developer in the UK or China. And while Apple has some fairly strongly worded guidelines about app store 'manipulation', that doesn’t stop people trying it.

Well now that effort seems to have been summed up in a single photograph, which has recently gone viral in China:

The photo appears to show a woman in front of a rack of about 100 iPhone 5Cs, downloading apps repeatedly from different accounts. It was published in local media, and resurfaced on Apple rumors site Cult of Mac and Tech In Asia.

However, the photo is completely unsourced, low-quality and unverified — so while many have speculated this is evidence of ranking manipulation ‘farms’, that's not quite right. The presence of the iPhone 5C suggests it's a relatively recent picture, but whether or not that means ranking manipulation has any effect in the real world we just don't know.

Also unclear is the veracity of another image going around which shows the prices being charged to break apps into the rankings list.

That picture claims it will cost a developer the equivalent of £7,400 to get an app into the Top 10, and about six times as much to keep it there for a week.

While app store rankings manipulation is clearly an issue in China - at least, there are companies willing to charge for the service, as evidenced by a simple search on local e-Commerce sites - what’s not clear is how much of an impact this would actually have on the App Store.

For its part, Apple has taken a tough line on rankings cheats. Apple says in its guidelines for developers that any effort to cheat the system will be dealt with swiftly and severely:

""If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal data from users, copy another developer's work, or manipulate the ratings) your Apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the developer program.""

""Developers who attempt to manipulate or cheat the user reviews or chart ranking in the App Store with fake or paid reviews, or any other inappropriate methods will be removed from the iOS Developer Program"""
1134,"According to an earlier report, it was suggested by a Reddit user that Apple might have quietly reinforced the iPhone 6 Plus to address the bending issues that users have been complaining about. It sounded good, but unfortunately as it turns out, it might not necessarily have been true, which we have to say is a bit unfortunate.
This is according to the folks at iFixit who responded to the original Reddit post with their own findings. According to the original post, the user claims that his newer iPhone weighs 21 grams more than his wife’s model. iFixit on the other hand who compared a day one model to a newly purchased model only noticed a 0.8 gram difference.
“I just went to the store and bought a brand-spanking-new iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Space Gray, Verizon unit…It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit.” However as noted on the Apple website, there is a small note that reads, “Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.” 9to5Mac’s source also tells them that a difference in 1.5 grams between any two iPhone 6 Plus models is expected.
Like we said this is a little unfortunate as we’re sure many users would have been pleased to learn that Apple could be reinforcing its iPhone 6 Plus models. However as Apple claimed back then, less than 10 users had officially come forward to complain about the reported bending, which means that it wasn’t as widespread as many would have thought it to be, but what say you? Are you a little disappointed by this?

1136,"IS jihadists kill 300 Iraqi soldiers in chlorine gas attack; urge killing of citizens from US-led coalition

Members of Iraqi Parliament from Diwaniyah Province report that Islamic State militants have killed over 300 soldiers using chlorine gas for the first time in Saqlawiyah, north of Fallujah.

""The terrorist organization ISIS used chlorine gas for the first time in the region of Saqlawiyah after trapping more than 400 troops, resulting in the deaths of many of them due to suffocation while the terrorist gangs detonated car bombs within the brigade headquarters.” said Islamic Dawa Party MP Ali al-Badri, at a press conference at the Iraqi parliament building.

Al-Badri continued on saying that he holds new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi responsible for failing to immediately send army backup to the district.

Kurds: IS offensive in Syria is genocide
The number of refugees seeking shelter in Turkey from IS' advance across northeastern Syria has hit 130,000, Turkey said Monday.

Residents fleeing the frontier town of Ayn al-Arab, known in Kurdish as Kobani, and its surrounding villages said the militants were executing people of all ages in the areas they had seized.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday up to 150,000 Kurds had been displaced - internally and externally - since IS launched its latest offensive against Kobani last Tuesday. It also said that clashes in the area overnight had killed 10 insurgents, bringing the number of IS fighters killed to at least 39. At least 27 Kurdish fighters have died.

Meanwhile the Islamic State group called on Muslims to kill citizens of all countries taking part in the US-led anti-jihadist coalition by any available means, in a statement posted online Monday.

""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European -- especially the spiteful and filthy French -- or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him,"" said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the group's spokesman.

""Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military,"" he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages.

Adnani's message -- which was released in an Arabic audio recording, together with transcripts in other languages including English -- gave instructions on how the killings could be carried out without military equipment.

""Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,"" the IS spokesman said. ""If you are unable to do so, then burn his home, car, or business. Or destroy his crops. If you are unable to do so, then spit in his face.""

Adnani praised militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, calling on them to ""cut the throats"" of those fighting for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

""O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders, know that the matter is more dangerous than you have imagined and greater than you have envisioned,"" he said.

""We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the (Islamic) State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders, not slaves.""

""We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted.""

And he mocked the US air campaign, saying ""Are America and all its allies from amongst the crusaders and atheists unable to come down to the ground?""

Addressing Obama, Adnani said: ""You claimed... that America would not be drawn to a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave, and destruction.""

IS has seized at least 64 villages around Kobani since Tuesday, using heavy arms and thousands of fighters. It executed at least 11 civilians on Saturday, including at least two boys, the Observatory said.

""ISIL (another term for IS) are continuing to advance. Every place they pass through they kill, wound and kidnap people. Many people are missing and we believe they were kidnapped,” Welat Avar, a doctor, told Reuters by telephone from Kobani.

A Kurdish politician from Turkey who visited Kobani on Saturday said IS' offensive is comparable to a genocide.

“Rather than a war this is a genocide operation ... They are going into the villages and cutting off the heads of one or two people and showing them to the villagers,” Ibrahim Binici, a deputy from Turkey’s pro-Kurdish HDP party, told Reuters.

Waiting for Obama's General Assembly speech
The head of the Syrian parliament, Mohammad al-Jihad, called on Sunday to the United States to cooperate with Damascus in the fight against IS rather than form an alliance with countries that support terrorism, referring to Saudi Arabia and other countries that support Syrian opposition groups seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

Meanwhile, the United States, which has carried out airstrikes against IS in Iraq, has said it is prepared to extend them into Syria.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Sunday that other countries were willing to join Washington in launching air strikes in Syria against IS militants. “We will not do the air strikes alone,” she told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" “But we’re going to leave it to other nations to announce for themselves what their specific commitments to the coalition are going to be.”

Power told ABC's ""This Week"" there was universal support for ""degrading and destroying"" Islamic state. ""I will make you a prediction,"" Power said. ""We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.""

Obama will give a speech at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State."
1137,"update

This story was a hoax written by a site which appeared to be the English-language website of the Chinese state-run broadcaster, CCTV. And we fell for it.

The original blog post, which was cited by us and other publishers, was published at cctvnews.cn. The fake site used CCTV’s logo and embedded tweets from the official @CCTVNEWS Twitter account.

The actual URL of CCTV English is english.cntv.cn.

However, an internet directory search shows that the fake CCTVNews site – which is now offline – is based in Hangzhou, 1,300 miles from CCTV’s real headquarters in Beijing.    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_4429703"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-12-08 04:28:40 -0500', 'update'); });

This week CCTV News, the state-run broadcaster, came up with these tips for any Chinese people considering an English name – one of which is to steer clear of “Dumbledore”.

It’s common for Chinese people to choose an English name, partly to make conversation with non-Chinese speakers easier. Many Chinese students in western colleges go by an English name, for example.

But as CCTV points out, some people are choosing names that might sound odd to English speakers.

The article says: “While native English speakers are stuck with whatever happy or unhappy names they’ve been given, Chinese and other ‘non-natives’ get the lucky choice of picking their own English name.

“However these choices can mean more than you think!”

Religious, mythical, and fictional characters such as Vampire, Satan, Medusa, and Edward Cullen are a no-no.

“Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers, it also suggests you have some connection to that name,” the article warns.

“So if you call yourself Satan, you might get a few foreigners thinking you’re anti-Christian, or possibly a member of a heavy metal band.”

CCTV says Harry is OK, if you’re a Harry Potter fan, but only because it was a common name to start with.

Also on the “no” list are common everyday words that aren’t used as names in English, such as Lawyer.

Other examples include Surprise, Dragon, and Fish – things that might be related to the characters in someone’s Chinese name.

“Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America.” CCTV says.

CCTV closes the article with this advice for anyone thinking of an English name:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes – you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Janes’, the jock boys are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks are called ‘Sheldon’."
1139,"Relatives of the more than 200 girls taken by militant group Boko Haram in Chibok, northern Nigeria expressed hope yesterday that a ceasefire deal said to have been signed between the Nigerian government and the Islamist group will end their nightmare and bring their families home.

However, restraint appeared to be the order of the day, with the details of any deal still hazy and no word yet from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. Wild celebrations might have been expected at the apparent end of an ordeal that has lasted more than six months but they were not in evidence, with many cautious about what might happen. But officials have made clear that the return of the girls is part of the deal.

""We will know the negotiations were successful when we see the girls physically. And then we will know it is true. And then we will celebrate,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok's local government, told the Associated Press.

Another resident, community leader Pogu Bitrus, told the news agency that ""people rejoiced, but with caution"".

Some reports on Friday night suggested the girls, taken from a school in Chibok back in April, could be released as early as tomorrow in neighbouring Chad – but Reuters reported yesterday, citing two senior government sources, that the Nigerian government would be looking to secure the release of the girls by Tuesday.

Yesterday Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said the authorities are ""inching closer to the release of the Chibok girls"". He later told Reuters that ""discussions will continue in Chad next week, and on the basis of those discussions we'll have more details"" on the girls' release.

The second source quoted by Reuters said that there might need to be further meetings in Nigeria or the Chadian capital N'Djamena to iron out the rest of the details for the deal. ""We have confidence in those we are negotiating with, but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could... disown the deal,"" he reportedly said.

During its 12-year existence – the past five have seen the group trying to create an Islamic state in the north of the country – Boko Haram has been split. Doubts have been raised by some analysts about Danladi Ahmadu, the self-proclaimed ""secretary general"" of Boko Haram who was named by President Goodluck Jonathan's principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, as the Boko Haram's representative in the talks. Ahmadu gave an interview to Voice of America in which he confirmed the ceasefire that was officially announced by Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria's military forces, on Friday.

In the interview Ahmadu appeared to say that he had not even met Abubakar Shekau.

This is not the first time a ceasefire has been called, hence the trepidation on the part of families in Chibok. In July 2013, when a government minister announced an agreement, Shekau quickly denied it using a video message – his preferred means of communication. He said that whoever the government negotiated with did not speak for him, and that he would never talk to infidels.

Leaders of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which gained the backing of politicians and public figures worldwide – including the US First Lady, Michelle Obama – summed up the mood.

""We are really cautious because there have been many times that such optimism has been expressed but did not materialise,"" Obi Ezekwesili, a former education minister said in a TV interview on Saturday. ""But all the same, we are hopeful,"" she said, according to the AFP news agency.

Quoted by the Leadership newspaper yesterday, the headteacher of the school from where the girls were taken, Asabe Kwambura, said she would be the ""happiest person in the world"" if the girls were to return

President Jonathan has faced criticism over his response to the abduction of the girls – and Boko Haram's continuing insurgency. He was set to attend a rally in Abuja yesterday where he was expected to officially announce his candidacy for presidential elections next year, leaving some to question the timing of the ceasefire announcement.

Publically, the President has also always said he would not release Boko Haram prisoners, a central demand of the group – but there has been speculation about such a deal.

Other than the girls, some of whom have escaped back to their families in the months since they were taken, many in the northern provinces where Boko Haram have killed thousands during their insurgency will be hoping the ceasefire holds. However, yesterday there were reports that suspected Boko Haram militants had killed several people in a number of attacks on Nigerian villages that occurred after the ceasefire announcement, security sources and witnesses told Reuters."
1140,"BANJA LUKA  – Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day excursion, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.

National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it. He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children. Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births. “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said. Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old. The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking. Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:”I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I’m only 14… But I am afraid I’ll be judged.” The page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes “Dnevni Avaz”. Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend. He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky. “It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,” he said."
1141,"Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm.

Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting.

Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle.

Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987.

Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million.

Rogen starred this year in Universal’s “Neighbors” and will be seen next with James Franco in Sony’s “The Interview.”

He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek."
1143,"She was reportedly arrested as they tried to cross from Syria

A wife and child of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have been detained by the Lebanese army, security officials have claimed.

The Lebanese army made the arrests as they crossed from Syria ten days ago, Reuters reports.

The woman was described by officials as “one of his wives”, while other reports have described her as his ""ex-wife"".

Al-Rai correspondent Elijah Magnier said a source within the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) had confirmed Saja Dulaimi, Baghdadi's ex-wife and her daughter were arrested in Lebanon.

However, Mr Magnier said another source within the LAF could not confirm she is his ex-wife.

The claims could not be immediately independently verified.   The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported the army had detained her in coordination with ""foreign intelligence apparatus"".

It said she had been travelling with a fake passport. Officials did not name or provide the nationality of the woman.

As-Safir said investigators were questioning her at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said accounts belong to Isis supporters were denying the reports.

He told The Independent the denials were being circulated with the hashtag “the arrest of the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a lie” along with lengthy statements claiming the reports were false.

Isis militants have taken control of swathes of Iraq and Syria since their insurgency began earlier this year. US-led coalition air strikes have targeted the group’s self-declared caliphate but have not yet halted its advance.

The Lebanese security forces have waged a crackdown on Islamic State sympathisers in Lebanon and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the border crossings.

They have arrested over the past few months a number of Islamic militants suspected of staging attacks to expand Islamic State influence in the country neighbouring Syria."

1152,"Is Kim Jong Un's sister running North Korea?

That's the latest question on the minds of North Korea watchers amid a storm of rumors that have built up in the weeks since Kim's last public appearance on Sept. 3. Other rumors suggest he is being treated for gout and that he has been hospitalized due to a cheese allergy.

With so little hard news leaking out of the Hermit Kingdom, it's impossible to confirm any of this — including the rumor that Kim's little sister, Kim Yo Jong, is the new show-runner. But there is evidence that she has upped her political profile over the past few years, and she may be one of the few people on the planet with direct access to North Korea's leader. Here's what we've been able to mine.

The two were born to Ko Yong Hui, a mistress of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Un was the middle child of this relationship, second to an older brother, while Kim Yo Jong is the former supreme leader's youngest child.

Image: RIA Novosti, Dmitry Astakhov, Presidential Press Service/Associated Press

The pair grew up in Ko Yong Hui's residence in Pyongyang as well as in Switzerland, where they both attended school for some time, and have a ""very good relationship,"" Michael Madden, who operates a blog called North Korea Leadership Watch, told Mashable. At one point, the two appeared in the same school recital.

She may have started working for the Korean Workers Party, the political establishment of which Kim Jong Un is the leader, around 2008, when her dad still ran the country. She reportedly worked to clear the way for her older brother to succeed her father once he died, though that's about all we know about their relationship.

Kim Yo Jong was born on Sept. 26, 1987. By the time she was eight she was off to Berne, Switzerland, to attend school near where her older brothers were doing the same.

She came back to North Korea roughly four years later, but not much is known about her activities until 2008, when she began to participate in the country's politics.

“She was one of the only ones that was distinctly interested in politics, in North Korean politics,"" Madden said. Her father, according to Madden, used to go around telling his friends about his daughter's sharp political mind.

Kim Yo-Jong, Kim Jong Un's younger sister..thought to be now running DPRK. pic.twitter.com/qTw0VP0e2t

— North Korea (@NorthKoreaNews1) October 7, 2014

Like many things about Kim Yo Jong and North Korea in general, her role in politics isn't clear.

She may have started working for her father or her aunt back in 2008 as a ""junior"" member of the party, according to NK Leadership Watch. When succession plans were finalized for her father's eventual passing, the powers that be reportedly gave her a significant part to play, possibly a position within her dad's personal secretariat or on the National Defense Commission.

She became a member of her father's inner circle by 2011, and that carried over to her brother's inner circle when Kim Jong Un took the reins later that year.

“She can get [Kim Jong Un] on the telephone, she can see him in person, that kind of thing,"" Madden said.

NK Leadership Watch has written that Kim Yo Jong plans her brother's appearances, ""including his itineraries, schedule, logistical needs and security arrangements."" This past March state media reportedly listed her as a senior official within the party — a first, according to the blog.

It's not much to go on, but Madden said that reports of turmoil at the top in North Korea are probably exaggerated. This is less likely to be a coup — and more likely, he said, that Kim Yo Jong is relaying her brother's orders while he takes a break.

But that doesn't mean the world should take their eyes off the little sister.

“Kim Jong Un is not a micromanager,"" Madden said. ""It’s very possible she could be running a lot more things than we think.”

1153,"Apple is targeting 19 hours of battery life under mixed usage conditions for its upcoming Apple Watch wearable, consistent with Apple CEO Tim Cook's estimate that users will want to charge the device daily.

When Cook unveiled Apple Watch in September, he was careful to paint in broad strokes, revealing a wide range of features, but little in the way of device specifications. The Apple chief later commented that  that owners will ""wind up charging it daily,"" though the company has remained tight lipped over the past four months.

On Thursday, people familiar with Apple's plans shed light on the situation, saying that as of 2014 the company targeted battery life at 19 hours of mixed usage, reports 9to5Mac. More specifically, Apple was aiming to squeeze out 2.5 to 4 hours in ""active"" app use, 3 days in standby and 4 days in sleep mode.

However, sources warn that a first-generation version may not reach Apple's goals. The same people say current standard use estimates put Apple Watch battery life at around 3.5 hours, dropping to 2.5 hours under heavy load, while power-saving passive modes can milk 2 to 3 days.

Apple is still tweaking software to find the right mix of performance and survivability. For example, the company is targeting 4 hours of continuous exercise tracking when linked to an iPhone, suggesting raw data is handed off to the more capable handset for processing.

Battery life continues to be one of the most significant technical hurdles for smartwatch manufacturers and Apple faces the same predicament with its small form factor device. Apple Watch packs in a custom-designed S1 system-on-chip approximately as powerful as the A5 processor, as well as a Retina-quality display, both major draws on what is expected to be a relatively low-capacity battery cell.

Apple has not yet set a firm release date for Apple Watch, but holds to an ""early 2015"" launch."
1154,"LAS VEGAS -- Former major league slugger Jose Canseco is recovering after shooting himself in the hand at his Las Vegas home.

Metro police Lt. Mark Reddon says officers responded to a call of an accidental shooting shortly after 2:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Reddon says Canseco told police he was cleaning his gun in the kitchen when it fired, shooting a finger on his left hand. He was taken to University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Canseco's fiancee, Leila Knight, tweeted from his account late Tuesday night, saying he was still in surgery and would be OK.

Canseco played 17 years in the major leagues, starring for the Oakland Athletics as one of the ""Bash Brothers"" in the late 1980s. He was part of the A's 1989 World Series championship team and last played for the Chicago White Sox in 2001.

The right-handed outfielder and designated hitter had 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay and the New York Yankees.

He later admitted to performance-enhancing drug use, with his 2005 book, ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big,"" amplifying MLB's doping issues.

Lonely: Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed was found at Ayr station with his toy, food and bowl in a suitcase

Staff now face days of work to whittle down the flood of applications to find Kai one new owner after poignant photos of him went viral.

Assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them.

'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before.

'What we're saying to people is fill out a questionnaire, and Anna the manager and I will have a wee look through, whittle them down and make a decision. It'll be hard but we'll get there.

'We just can't believe how big this became, but then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase.'

Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity.

Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted.

He may also need surgery for entropions, inward-curling eyelids, which the charity will pay for.

Ms Cavanagh added: 'He's loved the attention. He's been in and out of his kennel so many times being filmed and having his picture taken. He's a very happy boy and he's behaved perfectly.

'We're also seeing a boost in donations. A lot of people have come here in person and mentioned him.'

Animal welfare experts warned his owners could face a lifetime ban from keeping animals after the 'cruel' incident.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: 'The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

Cared for: Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday

'We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

'This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online, as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

'Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible.

'If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

'Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.'

1165,"As the anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, there are growing fears that stolen jetliners could be used in attacks.
The Washington Free Beacon reports that Islamists in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month when they overran the Tripoli International Airport. There are fears the jets may end up being used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed to the U.S. government over the past two weeks warning that one or more aircraft may be used in an attack on 9/11 or later this month.

""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,"" said one official.

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked by terrorists who killed four Americans including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. The attack was originally blamed on an ""anti-Muslim video"".

Tensions continue to be high across the region. With the rise of ISIS and a second American journalist beheaded, security is going to be on high alert.

A senior State Department counter-terrorism official was asked to comment on reports on the stolen jetliners but he declined. Another said ""we can't confirm that."""
1166,"On Friday, the Nigerian military reportedly agreed to a truce with the militant group Boko Haram. According to the announcement, more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed. According to CNN, the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week.

In August, the militant group Boko Haram declared an ""Islamic state"" in northeastern Nigeria, a territory largely occupied by the fighters. Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area.

This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place. Here's what has happened since.

On April 14, 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, according to official figures. The mass abduction occurred at night, and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear. Shortly after the abductions, a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers, but the remarks turned out to be wrong. Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned: Its reputation in the rural north is bad, and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes. One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners' throats, according to Amnesty International.

In the weeks following the mass kidnapping, criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls. In May, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would ""remain slaves with us.""

Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted, and according to estimates, more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants.

Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months: The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle. Most of the escapes, however, took place shortly after the abductions, as this graph shows. As time passed, hope faded for many parents, and reports of escapes became less frequent. ""The longer they're there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down,"" Jennifer Cook, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Time magazine this week, before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them. There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity — some say 215, some say 219.

The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April. Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since.

Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria, where the girls were kidnapped, but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country.

The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers, or 193,000 square miles. Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of the United Kingdom. However, Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active.

Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence — a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors — have risen rapidly since 2010, and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise. The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year, according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years.

Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily, it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines. The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media.

Up until May 13, about 3.3 million tweets were posted, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. According to the BBC, most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria (27 percent) and the United States (26 percent). Still, thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls.

The social media campaign found prominent supporters: As of Oct. 17, more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama's message: ""Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.""

The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May. In a letter, the White House said: ""These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,"" and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls. Chad is east of Nigeria. Other countries, such as China, France and Britain, have also sent military assistance to the region.

According to some reports, Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May. The value of a girl, according to Boko Haram: $12. The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions. In a video message, Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced: ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.""

The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls. In 2013, the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its ""Rewards for Justice Program,"" offering up to $7 million for information that led to his capture. Those efforts have been unsuccessful. A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom.

Meanwhile, USAID — the international development agency of the United States — has devoted about $150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers.

The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria. Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno, the state in which the kidnappings took place.

The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence. Boko Haram's name can be translated as ""Western education is sin."""

Outside of school, he often takes his friends out to dine at Morimoto on 10th Avenue, where they feast on $400 caviar, expensive dishes and freshly-squeezed apple juice.

During an interview for the magazine;s 10th annual 'Reasons to Love New York issue', Mohammed refused to disclose his exact net worth, but he admitted it was in 'the high eight figures'.

The successful teenager revealed he had used his incredible wealth to purchase a BMW - which he does not yet have a license to drive - and rent a Manhattan apartment.

However, his parents, who are immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, will not yet allow him to move out of their family home in Queens, according to the New York Post.

Mohammed has also taken to social media to show off his well-funded, lavish lifestyle - regularly posting videos of him partying, playing poker and dancing with numerous women on Instagram.

His hard-earned cash has certainly been beneficial to his parents. 'My dad doesn't work now and I tend to help out with things, and futures gives me that incentive,' said the student.

But despite its advantages, Mr and Mrs Islam are not overly keen on their son's interest in trading.

'My dad doesn't like [finance] that much,' Mohammed, who has written the phrase, 'More money, less problems', on his Instagram profile, said in an ISSUU interview.

'He says he is ok with me trading, but my mom is skeptical about the market. But they see it as, if I am good at it, then why not?'

A year after he started experimenting with penny stocks, Mohammed was introduced to further financial markets by his cousin. He has since developed a 'life-long passion' for trading.

'What makes the world go round? Money,' he said. 'If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.'

On his LinkedIn profile, the student said he rose to success while trading stocks during his lunch breaks because he 'followed the market, hunted for opportunities and used everything from fundamental analysis to technical analysis and price action to speculate in the markets'.

After having high returns in penny stocks, he moved on to small-mid cap equities, then derivatives, before feeling out the futures market and specializing in oil and gold, he said.

He added he has now developed 'a passion for understanding the markets and a passion for making money', and trades 'mainly based on volatility and volume'.

Let me take a selfie: Mohammed has the phrase, 'More money, less problems', written on his Instagram profile. Above, a female reveller is pictured taking a selfie in another video on Mohammed's Instagram

Speech: Speaking of his passion for trading stocks, Mohammed (pictured giving a speech), who trades 'mainly based on the volatility and volume' of gold and oil, said: 'What makes the world go round? Money'

During his interview with New York magazine's, Mohammed revealed his biggest inspiration in the finance world has been Paul Tudor Jones.

Jones, 60, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund, ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Mohammed said that while he had been 'paralyzed' by his losses when he first started trading, he quickly learned from Connecticut-based Jones's ability to get back into the game again and again.

'I had been paralyzed by my loss,' he said. 'But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over.'

Inspiration: Mohammed revealed his biggest inspiration in the finance world has been Paul Tudor Jones (pictured), the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund

Speaking to Business Insider, he added: 'Jones’s personality and technique are what make him so successful and I aspire to become even one per cent of the man he is.

'He went through obstacles, yet still came out on top'

And despite his massive fortune, Mohammed has no plans to give up trading just yet.

The teenager said he and his trader friends hope to start a hedge fund in June - when he is old enough to get his broker-dealer license - and intend to make a billion dollars by next year.

This, of course, will all be done while attending college.

'It’s not just about the money,' said Mohammed, whose ultimate goal is to pave a path in the financial industry that will enable him to become a reputable hedge fund manager.

'We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.'"

1175,"A spokesman for the Iraqi health ministry denied reports in a local newspaper that militants in Mosul had Ebola

Reports that Isis fighters in Iraq have contracted Ebola have been refuted as “incorrect” and “unfounded” by the country’s health ministry.

Despite reports on Wednesday in the Iraqi paper, al-Sabah, that two cases of Ebola had been reported in Mosul in the north of the country, Ahmed Rudaini, the health ministry’s spokesman dismissed the speculation.

He said the disease could not have been registered, as only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the “diagnostic capabilities” to confirm cases of Ebola which was reported by the al-Maalomah news website and the International Business Times.

The World Health Organisation also confirmed that they had received no confirmation of Ebola cases from Iraq.

Tarik Jasarevic from the organisation told The Independent: ""WHO is aware of these reports and is working closely with Iraqi MoH to get more information.

""It is unlikely that this case can be a confirmed Ebola case as there is no laboratory facility in Mosul that could do an Ebola test.""

WHO’s director of communications, Christy Feig had earlier told Mashable: “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

The organisation has reached out to the Iraqi government to investigate the claims, should it require assistance, however.

Al-Sabah initially reported that “terrorists” from several unnamed African countries had brought the virus to the country and claimed that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS had been registered by authorities.

Although Isis has recruited foreign fighters in the past, it believed that the majority came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Very few, if any, militants are thought to have travelled from at-risk areas of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Sources also confirmed that an investigation is underway into Zehaf-Bibeau’s connections in Calgary. 

Though little is known so far about the man alleged to have shot and killed Canadian soldier Nathan Cirillo, a Montreal criminal court database shows a man with the same name was arrested five times while living in Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in Feb. 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in Dec. 2004. He served one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.


Zehaf-Bibeau also pled guilty to a Mar. 2004 charge of failing to respect parole conditions. He served one day in prison for that offence.

The criminal court database also shows a“Michael Bibeau-Zehaf”was convicted of marijuana possession in 2009.

A Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in Vancouver in December 2011 with robbery.

He pleaded guilty in February of 2012 to the lesser charge of uttering threats, for which he was sentenced to one day in jail in addition to 66 days credit for time served.

Court records indicate he was seen by a psychiatrist while in jail and found fit for trial.

The Vancouver police and the B.C. RCMP have confirmed they are working with the municipal police and Mounties in Ottawa, though they have declined to provide any more information.

As of 2004, Zehaf-Bibeau’s address was located in Montreal’s Villeray neighbourhood along St. Dominique.

The Ottawa Citizen reported that a Zehaf-Bibeau listed an Aylmer, Quebec address when he was charged with breaching release conditions from a previous charge.

1179,"Supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria militant group have recently circulated pictures of the “Cub of Baghdadi,” who they say is the youngest ISIS “martyr” from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria.

On “The Cub of Baghdadi Channel” on YouTube, ISIS supporters on Oct. 7 published an obituary for the young boy.

“In life we have met, and in the afterlife, we have the hope - we ask God to see you in happiness, in a place where this no boredom. In heaven,” it read.

The YouTube video featured a collage of pictures of the young boy who is believed to be 10-years-old. The images, which show him wearing military clothes and carrying arms, cannot be independently verified however.

Other pictures show him posing with his “martyred” father. The video has garnered at least 56,296 views as of Thursday.

On Twitter, a “Cub of Baghdadi is Staying” twitter account dedicated to the boy has 4,309 followers as of Thursday.

There were mixed reactions to the reports of his death.

On YouTube, one user commenting said “Oh mother, I did not die, but I am a martyr with my God,” while another user on Twitter said: “God bless you cub of Baghdadi, your picture has made me cry. I swear I wished if I was in your
place.”

Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, told The Independent newspaper that those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria.

However, there were others who criticized and scorned the use of children in conflict.

On YouTube commented said: “Unfortunately everyday a child in Palestine is martyred either because of conflict, hunger or sickness. We did not see anyone objecting…”

Another rebuked the use of children in conflicts on YouTube: “Is this holy jihad? Brainwashing kids’ brains?”

On Twitter user said: “Cub of Baghdadi youngest ISIS fighter killed, the child from the Arabian Peninsula came to kill other Arabs, what a great upbringing.”

Another Twitter user said: “ISIS has announced the killing of its youngest jihadist, and says he is in heaven with 72 Barbie dolls,” in apparent reference to a saying propagated by extremist groups that men will be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven.

The United Nations has previously rebuked the group for using children below the age of 15 and accused it of committing war crimes."

New York Magazine recently profiled Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old senior at Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School who decided to start trading stocks during his lunch break and found himself all the richer for it. 

$72 million richer, to be precise. 

Islam, the son of Bengali immigrants from Queens, is the president of the school's Investment Club and has been profiled by Business Insider for his financial acumen. Mo, as he's known, won't disclose his full net worth but says it's in ""the high eight figures."" 




Mo's got an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, though his parents won't let him move out of their house until he's 18. He bought a BMW, but he doesn't have a license to drive it – his dad drives him on inspirational tours past the home of his idol, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge-funder and private asset manager who's ranked the 108th richest American, according to Forbes. 

Islam recalls that, when he first experimented with penny stocks (at the tender age of 9), he lost some of the money he'd saved up from tutoring, which caused him to swear off trading briefly. But he was reinvigorated by Jones's story and quotes his idol: ""You learn more from your losses than from your gains.""

In an alarmist bombshell statement that intersects both America’s war on terror and its fight to secure the border with Mexico, Rep. Duncan Hunter said ISIS fighters have been caught attempting to cross into the U.S.

Hunter, a California Republican and former Marine major, told Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday that Border Patrol agents have captured Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militants trying to get into Texas from Mexico.

“ISIS is coming across the southern border,” said Hunter, whose district includes much of San Diego. “They aren’t flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

“At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter continued. “There’s nobody taking about it.”

When Van Susteren pressed him for his source, the Congressman replied: “I’ve asked the Border Patrol.”

“They caught them at the border,” Hunter said. “Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.”

1187,"An American hostage in Yemen held by al-Qaeda has been freed, according to statements from the country’s defense ministry on Saturday, however his sister has received information of his death.

The defense ministry said on its website that an operation by Yemen's armed forces early on Saturday freed photojournalist Luke Somers and led to the killing of 10 members of the militant group holding him, according to Reuters news agency. 

It said the operation took place in the Wadi Abdan Al Daqqar region of Shabwa Province in the southern part of the country. 

But his sister Lucy Somers told The Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother’s death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington, nor from security officials in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.

Meanwhile another account suggests Somers was wounded during the operation. 

""American soldiers carried away the hostage. He was wounded and we don't know if he is dead or alive,"" the Yemeni official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity.

Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al-Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers, 33, and a local al-Qaeda commander threatening that Somers would meet his fate in three days if the United States doesn’t meet the group’s demands, which weren’t specified.

In a video posted Saturday near London, Lucy Somers describes her older brother as a romantic who “always believes the best in people.” She ends with the plea: “Please let him live.”

In a statement, Somers’ father, Michael, calls his son “a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people” and asks for his safe release.

“When foreign nationals were advised to leave Yemen, Luke refused to go, saying he felt safe and at home there,” Lucy Somers said in her video. “He felt the Yemeni people would look after him.”

“Photojournalism has been his way of highlighting the struggles of the Yemeni people,” she said.

Michael Somers said his son “was confident that no one would harm him for his simplicity and honest friendship to all Yemenis around him.”

Luke Somers “told all his friends and loved ones stories of Yemenis’ generosity, humility and devoted friendship,” his father said, adding, “Luke’s life in Yemen these past three and a half years should not have ended with a kidnapping but with a great reward. The fact that he chose to live in Yemen and not the United States shows where his sympathies lay. Please bring Luke back to us safe and sound.”

Somers’ brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, offered a similar message in an earlier video.

“My life is in danger,” Luke Somers said in the al-Qaiea footage, which appeared to mimic hostage videos released by al-Qaida’s rival, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. He asked for help.

In a statement Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a raid last month had sought to rescue Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan also said President Barack Obama had authorized a rescue operation to free Somers and other hostages but “regrettably, Luke was not present.”

A founding member of 1980s revolutionary hip hop group The Sugarhill Gang, Big Bank Hank was best known for his verses on 'Rapper's Delight,' which was No. 248 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Big Bank Hank, one of the founding members of iconic 1980s hip hop group The Sugarhill Gang, died early Tuesday morning after a battle with cancer. He was 57.

The news was first reported by music blog InFlexWeTrust.com. TMZ reported that the rapper — born Henry Jackson on Aug. 5, 1957, in the Bronx — died at about 2 a.m. Tuesday in the greater New York City area.

“So sad to hear of our brother’s passing,” wrote fellow group members Wonder Mike and Master Gee in a statement to TMZ.

An Iraqi official today denied that a woman detained in Lebanon yesterday is the wife of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as confusion continues to reign over the identity of a woman and child captured by the Lebanese army near the border with Syria, AP reported.

Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim told AP that the woman in question was indeed called Saja al-Dumani, as reported yesterday. However, Ibrahim said she is not al-Baghdadi’s wife, as Lebanese officials had claimed. Instead, she is the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dumani, an Iraqi terror suspect being held by authorities in the country, Ibrahim said.

BuzzFeed News’ report from yesterday follows below.    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_4395015"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-12-03 07:11:48 -0500', 'update'); });

The Lebanese army says it has detained the wife of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi close to the country’s border with Syria, the BBC reported. A child has also reportedly been detained.

A file image made from video posted on a militant website shows the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq.  AP Photo/Militant video, File

Although their identities have not officially been made public, Reuters is reporting that the woman in question is an Iraqi named Saja al-Dulaimi, citing a security official and a senior political source. She is one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail as part of a prisoner swap for 13 nuns held by al-Qaeda–linked Syrian militants in March.

The al-Safir newspaper said that Baghdadi’s wife was currently being interrogated by Lebanon’s Defense Ministry, the BBC reported.

There have been conflicting reports as to whether the child is Baghdadi’s daughter or son. The security official cited by Reuters said it is his daughter, and that DNA tests have been carried out to confirm she is Baghdadi’s child. However, the BBC is reporting that the child is his son.

It is also unclear when the pair were detained by Lebanese authorities, with Reuters saying it occurred “in recent days,” while a source told AFP they were taken near Arsal 10 days ago.

Speaking to CNN, terror expert and Director at the Asia Pacific Foundation Sajjan M. Cohel said, “It’s certainly a new dynamic because we’ve never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained.”

However, Cohel questioned what the pair were doing in Lebanon: “Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?”

Very little is known about al-Baghdadi. He has not been seen in public since June, and last month ISIS denied reports that he had been injured or killed by an air strike by U.S.–lead forces near Mosul."
1195,"The Islamist group Boko Haram has denied claims by Nigeria’s government that it has agreed to a ceasefire and will release more than 200 abducted schoolgirls.

The announcement came in a video sent to Agence France-Presse on Saturday in which the militant group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, ruled out future talks with the government and said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being kidnapped more than six months ago.

Some 276 schoolgirls were seized from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state in April. Many escaped in the first couple of days but 219 remain missing.

More than 500 women and girls aged from infancy to 65 have been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held in militant camps since 2009, Human Rights Watch said this week, including 60 reportedly kidnapped from two towns in north-eastern Nigeria last week. Many have been targeted because they are Christians or attending school.

Girls and women abducted by the Islamist group and later released have spoken of life in captivity that included forced marriage and labour, rape, torture, psychological abuse and coerced religious conversion.

Shekau said in the latest video that all of the Chibok schoolgirls had become Muslims. “They have now memorised two chapters of the Qur’an,” he said.

Speaking in Hausa, he said: “We have married them off. They are in their marital homes.”

Families of the Chibok schoolgirls said they were shocked but not surprised at the marriage claims.

Pogo Bitrus, the head of the Chibok Elders Forum, said: “We were sceptical about the talks to release our girls and we never took the ceasefire seriously because since the announcement, they have never stopped attacking communities. Therefore the information that our girls have been married off is not surprising to us.”

Bitrus has four nieces among the hostages. “We are only hoping the government will step up whatever efforts it is making to quell the insurgency,” he said.

Enoch Mark, a Christian pastor in Chibok whose daughter and niece are among the hostages, said the girls’ families were “lost for words”.

“Since they were kidnapped we have no certainty about the situation they are in. We keep getting conflicting information,” he said. “We only keep hoping that they will be returned to us.”

Daniel Bekele of Human Rights Watch said the Chibok kidnappings and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign had focused global attention on the vulnerability of girls in north-eastern Nigeria.

“Now the Nigerian government and its allies need to step up their efforts to put an end to these brutal abductions and provide for the medical, psychological and social needs of the women and girls who have managed to escape,” he said."

“We found out on Sept. 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” he added.
The official also said that the missing jets were a serious threat and a counterterrorism concern.

Dozens of jets went missing after the Dawn of Libya group overran Tripoli’s international airport on Aug. 23.
The Libyan militants Sunday supposedly posted online pictures of themselves posing with some of the aircraft.

In the pictures, the militants were seen climbing onto the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

During the 2001 attack, a total of 2,753 people lost their lives when Al-Qaeda hijackers flew two airliners into the New York World Trade Center’s Twin Towers.

The Guardian posted this enhanced audio of Emwazi’s voice from a January 2015 video:

w.soundcloud.com

Cage UK, a counter-terrorism activist group which had discussions with Emwazi before he left for Syria, has issued a statement blaming British foreign policy for his radicalisation:

“Like Michael Adebolajo, suffocating domestic policies aimed at turning a person into an informant but which prevent a person from fulfilling their basic life needs would have left a lasting impression on Emwazi. He desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him.”

“We now have evidence that there are several young Britons whose lives were not only ruined by security agencies, but who became disenfranchised and turned to violence because of British counter-terrorism policies coupled with long standing grievances over Western foreign policy.

“This case should trigger thinking about British domestic and foreign policy. What risk assessments, if any, have been made about British counter-terrorism policy and the key part it plays in radicalising individuals? How have the security services been allowed to get away with abusing British citizens without redress? Why are the long-standing grievances over Western interventions in the Muslim world been ignored?

One of Emwazi’s neighbours in Queen’s Park, who identified himself only as Abdullah, told reporters that the family seemed very normal.

He added that he had lived in the block for three years, but had had very little interaction with the Emwazis.  Carl Court / Getty Images

The jihadist fighter was previously named as the most likely of three suspects being investigated by the British security services. Abdel Bary is, however, believed to be an ISIS fighter, having been pictured holding the severed head of a prisoner in Syria.

British officials are not pleased with the decision to identify “Jihadi John”. David Cameron’s spokesman has declined to confirm his identity.

Reporters were also told that MI5’s work could be affected by the decision to out Emwazi.

Reporters are gathering outside the flat in Queen’s Park where Emwazi’s family are believed to live.

Emwazi has been previously named in UK court documents as having connections to a network of Islamist extremists based in Somalia.

Jihadi John: Here's one of the court documents that includes Emwazi, the man known to be the ISIS militant:

AFP

“Jihadi John”, the masked ISIS militant who featured in videos threatening the beheading of multiple hostages, has been identified as a west Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi by the BBC and the Washington Post, which cited Emwazi’s friends and individuals in the security services.

“Jihadi John” appeared in multiple videos wielding a knife and threatening ISIS hostages including journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US national Peter Kassig, and Japanese nationals Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto Jogo.

Emwazi was described by the Washington Post as a computer science graduate from the University of Westminster.

The newspaper said Emwazi was born in Kuwait, is in his mid-twenties, and was depicted by those who knew him as someone who was “polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith”.

He was described as being from a well-off family, and as having spent several years working in Kuwait before heading to Syria in around 2012.

The newspaper said Emwazi had also operated under the name Muhammad ibn Muazzam, and that British security services questioned him in 2010.

An individual named Muhammad ibn Muazzam was identified by The Independent in May 2010 as having been questioned by security services with a friend after coming home from a safari in Tanzania.

“The men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country,” The Independent reported at the time.

In the piece, the two men claimed they were “held for ‘days’ in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5”.

The Guardian has obtained emails in which Emwazi said MI5 attempted to recruit him. The newspaper wrote:

In emails seen by the Guardian, Emwazi said the British agent knew “everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with”. He then it is claimed attempted to “turn” Emwazi, asking: “Why don’t you work for us?”. When he refused MI5 said “life would be harder for you”.

Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan police’s Counter Terrorism Command unit has declined to confirm the identity of the jihadi, saying:

We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation."

1202,"Officials are using 'very sophisticated voice-identification technology' to home in on the masked extremist who carried out the murder of the American journalist, said Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the U.S. A prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper who left his family a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics.

Authorities are close to identifying the black-clad Islamic State jihadist who beheaded an American journalist — and a prime suspect is a British-born rapper who left his parent’s million-dollar home last year to fight in Syria.

The British ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott, said Sunday that officials are using high-tech voice recognition tools to zero in on the masked fanatic who carried out the brutal murder of American journalist James Foley.

“We are close,” Westmacott said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There is some very sophisticated voice-identification technology and other measures that we have got which should allow us to be very clear about who this person is before very long.”

British newspapers reported Sunday that investigators were looking at several home-grown jihadists. The prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper, who left his family’s $1 million home a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics and once posted a Twitter photo of himself holding a severed head, The Sunday Times reported.

He is one of six children of Abdel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges in connection with Al Qaeda’s twin 1998 bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the son of an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges, went from rapping to posing with guns as a fighter for ISIS.

After spending years in and out of Egyptian prisons, subjected to torture, the elder Bary and his wife Ragaa were granted political asylum in Britain in 1993. He was arrested for the bombings in 1998 and was extradited to the United States in 2012 after a protracted legal battle.

Ragaa’s story is told in the book, “Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Woman of the War on Terror.”

The younger Bary rapped under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn Matic, and his songs had been featured on the BBC’s Radio 1 Extra, media outlets reported.

In one freestyle posted on his Facebook page, he raps about being addicted to alcohol and “the rock.”

“I swear the day when they came and took my dad, I could have killed a couple too . . . Imagine back then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick . . . violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

In July 2013, he posted on Facebook, “The Unknown mixtape with my bro tabanacle will be the last music I’m ever releasing. I have left everything for the sake of Allah.”

On Aug. 13, he tweeted a photo of himself in Ragga, Iraq, holding a severed head and the caption “Chilllin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” The Times of London reported. His Twitter account was suspended soon afterward.

Bary also tweeted a threat in June: “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon,” according to the Sunday Times.

In March, The Daily Mail reported that Bary claimed on Twitter he and another British jihadist were kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of a rival terrorist group.

ISIS hostages referred to him and several other militants with British accents as “the Beatles.”

The black-masked man who beheaded Foley in a video posted to YouTube on Tuesday had a distinct British accent.

Some 500 Brits have traveled to the Middle East to join the terrorist group, Westmacott said, calling it “a betrayal of all that we stand for.”

Federal officials have estimated that at least 100 Americans could be fighting with Sunni extremists who have seized territory throughout western Syria and northwestern Iraq.

U.S. lawmakers joined in sounding the alarm about the threat from the radicalized jihadists — especially the many foreign fighters with American and European passports who could easily travel to the West.

“They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores,” Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on “Meet the Press.”

He said the number of militants with Western documents is “much higher” than the estimate of 2,000 that has been reported.

“They get new recruits every single day,” he said. “If that's a British citizen, we believe it was ... that individual goes back home and . . . buys one plane ticket, they’re in the United States,"" said Rogers. “We may or may not know who that individual is. That's what's so dangerous about this, and why we can't let them continue unabated.”

Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the militants “present the greatest threat we’ve seen since 9/11.”

“This has been festering for the last year and now it’s culminating with the killing and the beheading of an American journalist, which I think is a turning point,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“The American people — it has sort of opened their eyes to what ISIS really is, the true character of ISIS, how savage they really are, and their intent to harm Americans.”

The FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a bulletin to local law enforcement Friday saying there are no specific or credible threats to U.S. soil from the militant group in retaliation for intensified airstrikes in Iraq.

Bernard the polar bear has stood outside The Loft Café, in Shefford, Bedfordshire, since December 1 and has delighted children with his Christmas inspired singing and dancing.

But staff at the cafe were left stunned on Monday when they got a visit from local council officers.

Owners Rob and Teresa Farndon were told there had been complaints of a noise nuisance and they needed to investigate Bernard’s racket.

Cafe worker Abbie McGee, 19, argued the bear was there for the whole of last December without any complaints but that didn’t seem to make a difference.

‘The children love him and there’s even one woman who used to put 20p in his pocket every time she went past,’ she said.

‘I can’t believe there have been complaints, is no-one allowed to have fun anymore?

Central Bedfordshire Council confirmed they had visited the premises ‘on a number of occasions’ and Bernard was subject to an ‘ongoing investigation’.

""Today the entire world is appalled by the brutal murder of Jim Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,"" Obama said in a statement from Martha's Vineyard, where he is on vacation. ""James was taken from us in an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.""

On Tuesday, the group formerly known as ISIS released a video of militants beheading Foley, claiming it was in retribution for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. The Federal Bureau of Investigations said Wednesday they believe the video to be authentic.

Obama said he spoke to Foley's family earlier Wednesday to offer his condolences.

""Jim Foley's life stands in stark contrast to his killers,"" Obama said. ""Let's be clear about ISIL. They have rampaged across cities and villages killing unarmed citizens in cowardly acts of violence. ... No faith teaches people to massacre innocents. No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day.""

""Their ideology is bankrupt,"" he said. ""People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy.""

Obama pledged to continue to ""do what is necessary"" to protect Americans and support the Iraqi forces fighting back the extremist group, despite their threats.

""We will be vigilant and we will be relentless,"" he said."

A husband who thought the voicemail message of his late wife he had been saving was lost forever has been reunited with it after 14 years, describing hearing her voice again as ""just a wonderful, wonderful sound"".

Stan Beaton kept the outgoing voicemail message following his wife Ruby's death in 2003, but technical work carried out by Virgin Media caused it to be deleted.

The telecoms company managed to restore it however, much to the 68-year-old's delight.

""They've made this old age pensioner extremely happy,"" he said. ""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever. I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""

The moment he was played the message back is in the video above, with the Mirfield man becoming overcome with emotion as what under different circumstances would just be a run of the mill voicemail plays.

""I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed,"" he told BBC Radio Leeds.

""Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

""In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

1210,"Call it Newton’s third law of Apple analysts: For every extreme reaction one way, there is an equally extreme reaction the other.

In this case, what that means is that while some doomsayers are happy to write off the Apple Watch as the worst thing Apple has done since building its own smartphone, taking on the music industry with iTunes, [insert actual bad decision], others go in totally the opposite direction and predict a landslide victory in Apple’s favor.

Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research falls somewhat into the latter category. His prediction? That the Apple Watch will have 100,000 apps ready to go when it launches in April, and that 42 million units will have sold by the end of December.

Chowdry’s claim about 100,000 apps is based on his attending six Apple Watch-Kit hackathons over “the past few months.” Although I don’t doubt that there will be plenty of apps ready to go on the day, I’d be frankly shocked if it’s close to that number. By comparison, it took the iOS App Store 16 months to hit 100,000 apps — by which point it had seen approximately 2,000,000,000 total downloads.

His 42 million prediction is a bit closer to the mark, and in line with other reports pegging sales as likely to fall between 30-60 million units in its first year on the market. While 42 million would be a fraction of the number of units Apple sells of the iPhone, it would still be enough to make it the runaway fastest selling new iOS device in history. The iPad, by comparison, sold 19.5 million units in its first year, while the iPhone moved a relatively paltry 5.4 million units.

Chowdry thinks that the Apple Watch will then go on to convert virtually every existing iPhone user, noting: “Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with ‘Glance’ and ‘Notifications’ to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user.”

Chowdry also gives us a neat way of explaining away the fact that we spent upwards of $350 on an Apple Watch to our non-techy partners. “The $350 price of Apple Watch appears to be a non-issue,” he writes, since, “On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350 ..i.e. $3.50 per device.”

Finally, he argues that we shouldn’t think about a “killer app” for the Apple Watch, as:

“Different people have different killer Applications for their devices. For some it is the games, for others it is the social messaging, or it is the navigation, or it is the music, or it is video, or it is email …and so on and so forth. Debating on “what is the killer app for the device” is passe’ – somewhat of pre-year-2007 thinking, when the killer App used to be “Ringtones”. Thinking of Apple Watch from the Watch perspective is also fundamentally flawed: The best Watch on the market is probably a 3 App Device – it tells time, may be Day (Monday, Tuesday etc.), it may also have a stop watch…thats it! By April 10, 2015, we are expecting 100,000 Apple Watch Apps on AppStore. Currently, on an average there are 65 Apps per iPhone. We are estimating that an average Apple Watch will have 100 Apps per Apple Watch. There will be no single killer app for Apple Watch – each user will have their own set of Killer Apps … one way to think is that the consumer is getting 100 different devices in one Apple Watch.”

This last point I can absolutely agree with. The notion of a “killer app” as VisiCalc was to the Apple II, for instance, is outdated thinking. To be the kind of mass market device it needs to be, the Apple Watch will have to be all things to all people — which is essentially what the iPhone currently manages to be.

We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see if Chowdry’s figures hold water, but there’s no doubting his enthusiasm. And at a time when Apple can seemingly do no wrong, who can entirely blame him?"
1212,"Tiger Woods divorced Swedish model Elin Nordegren in 2010, but he’s only now decided to unload his private island near Stockholm. The Los Angeles Times reports the luxury property has an asking price of $7.1 million.

The agency searching for a buyer made no secret of Woods’ motivation to sell. Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, said the property is of little practical use to the golf superstar.

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden any more.”

Nordegren told People in May of 2014 that she and Woods live a 25-minute drive apart in Southern Florida and share custody of their two children, daughter Sam and son Charlie. The children were, at that time, 6 and 5 respectively.

“I have moved on and I am in a good place. My relationship with Tiger is centered around our children and we are doing really good — we really are — and I am so happy that is the case. He is a great father.”

Nordegren gave the interview to People as she finally received her psychology degree after nine years of chipping away at courses. She graduated with a 3.96 GPA and gave the commencement address at her institution, Rollins College. Her speech made a silent reference to her marriage to Woods.

“Education has been the only consistent part of my life the last nine years. And it has offered me comfort. Education is one thing that no one can take away from you.”

The island is in Sweden’s Lake Mälaren and boasts a villa, hunting lodge, landing strip, stables, woods, lush parks, and tee-off area. There’s also a unique historical artifact: an 11th-century Viking stronghold. But anyone who buys the property will have to ferry in a couch, since the property is listed as unfurnished.

The Boston Herald reports that after Elin and Tiger’s divorce, they sold their home in Windermere, Florida, to another golf star, left-hander Bubba Watson. Woods’ extensive Florida compound is in Hobe Sound, Florida, and Nordegren’s Florida home is in North Palm Beach.

Last year, Tiger Woods’ career earnings surpassed the $1.3 billion mark. ESPN quotes a Golf Digest report in stating that 88 percent of those earnings were for endorsements off the green. In 2013, Woods made $12 million playing golf and $71 million in endorsements.

After revelations came to light about Woods’ infidelity, his endorsement earnings dropped to an all-time low of $62 million in 2011. He made $100 million in endorsements in each of 2008 and 2009."
1213,"Nicaraguan officials say a meteorite gouged out a crater near the nation's capital city over the weekend, but scientists aren't so sure.

A committee formed by the Nicaraguan government determined that a new, 39-foot-wide (12 meters) crater found near the capital Managua's international airport was blasted out by a space rock strike Saturday night (Sept. 6), the Associated Press reported.

Some Managua residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday, which would be consistent with a meteorite impact. But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism, said Bill Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. [Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite (Video)]
""Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky,"" Cooke said. ""And no one reports a fireball, even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds.""
Further, Managua is a big city, with lots of potential witnesses to such a night-sky sight. People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth, in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight.

A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence, both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said.

""If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact, I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater,"" Jenniskens, of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, told Space.com via email.

No such pieces have been reported, and none are visible in photos of the crater, Cooke said.

""So I'm kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater,"" he said.

If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater, the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet (1 m) wide if made of iron, and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material, Cooke added.

Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC, which flew by Earth on Sunday (Sept. 7), the AP reported. But that is not the case, experts said.

""For those wondering, the event in Nicaragua (poss meteorite?) is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC. Different timing, different directions,"" NASA officials wrote today (Sept. 8) via the @AsteroidWatchTwitter account, which is run by the space agency's Near-Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California."

The charity added: “The 2–3-year-old Shar-Pei cross is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.”

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said:

The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

1215,"""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale.""

Christian Bale didn’t have to audition to win the role of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, says screenwriter Aaron Sorkin.

“Well, there was a meeting,” Sorkin told Bloomberg Television in an interview confirming that the Dark Knight star will play Jobs. “We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale.”

Sorkin, the writer behind television shows like The West Wing and The Newsroom, is adapting Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography for the big screen, four years after rendering Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, in the film The Social Network.

The Academy Award winning Bale was rumored to have won the role over other possible contenders, including Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Leonardo Dicaprio, according to The Verge.

But Sorkin confirmed in the interview posted Thursday that Bale will fill the challenging role.

“He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined,” Sorkin said. “There isn’t a scene or a frame that he’s not in. So it’s an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it.”"

Aaron Sorkin won an Oscar in 2011 for writing “The Social Network,” the 2010 film about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s humble start in 2003. (RELATED: First Full Trailer For ‘Exodus’ Is Intense)

Sorkin has said before that he plans for the film to be divided into three scenes, mainly.

The militant's identity was first reported by The Washington Post, which cited ""friends and others with familiar with his case."" The BBC also named the individual without citing sources.

Emwazi is a Briton born in Kuwait who is known to intelligence services, according to the BBC and the Washington Post.

The Washington Post reported that Emwazi grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming before traveling to Syria in 2012 and joining ISIS.

The Metropolitan Police said it would not confirm the reports and British government officials declined to comment.

""Jihadi John"" appeared in the videos showing the execution of American hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff and Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.

He was given his nickname by the U.K. press because he was one of four Britons, dubbed the ""Beatles"" by their prisoners. He is also thought to have used the nom de guerre ""Abu Saleh.""

1222,"Not news: A fabricated story coming out of North Korea. News: It's not North Korea doing the fabricating!

It's being widely reported that Kim Jong-Un is considering Scotland for his next restaurant venture, which will feature dog meat on the menu. What's not being reported is... well, anyone ever saying that in the first place.

We're here to help you, the reader, mull through all the hot garbage being served up today by telling you exactly what we know, and pointing out the news organizations that are spreading misinformation. Yes, it's FACT or SHITE time!

FACT: Kim Jong-Un already has a restaurant in Amsterdam. Kim Jong-Un's regime opened a North Korean chain restaurant called Pyongyang in Amsterdam in 2012. It was eventually closed down but reopened under the name Haedanghwa, according to CNBC. It also gets better-than-average Yelp reviews, and features noodles with bean paste and fried scallops. Yum!

FACT: A reporter for the Scotland Daily Post wants the dictator to open a restaurant in Scotland, but has no proof of a plan to do so. Let's break down the facts in the Sunday Post article. Reporter Gordon Blackstock asks, ""Is dictator Kim Jong-un planning to open a restaurant in Scotland?"" He claims that North Korea indeed has Scotland ""in its crosshairs"" -- a particularly bad metaphor to associate with a militaristic dictator. His source is a blogger with the North Korea Leadership Watch (which has no official ties to Kim Jong-Un). This blogger allegedly said that ""it would not surprise me if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.""

FACT: That blogger never actually said a restaurant is opening in Scotland. In fact, that blogger, Michael Madden, told The Huffington Post that the whole story is...

SHITE: Kim Jong-Un plans to open a restaurant in Scotland. Madden, who didn't even write up the story on his own blog, says that the use of his quote is misleading.

""Kim Jong Un is most certainly not thinking of opening restaurants anywhere,"" he told HuffPost Weird News. ""In terms of the sourcing I have nary a clue; this could come from local partners in Scotland floating a trial balloon or deliberately disseminated disinformation. If DPRK entities are thinking of opening restaurants in Europe, the UK, or the Republic of Ireland, Scotland would likely be on the short list which is what I said last week.""

FACT: ""News"" travels fast. The Daily Mail wrote up the fabricated story -- presumably off of the Sunday Post story, because it features the same quotes from Madden -- and then the internet went crazy. CNBC and Edinburgh News aggregated it, resulting in this reporter's editor going absolutely bonkers trying to figure out why we didn't have this story. We didn't have this story because it was never true.

FACT: If Kim Jong-Un were planning to open a restaurant in Europe, Scotland would ""likely be on the short list."" That's cool! But nobody ever said he plans to open anything. Heck, even if he did, the western version of the restaurant wouldn't feature dog meat like their North Korean counterparts reportedly do. We know this, because the Sunday Post's ""experts"" know this -- their experts being Michael Madden, a blogger who wouldn't touch this fake story with a 10-foot pole.

FACT: If Kim Jong-Un does open a restaurant in Scotland, we'll be embarrassed. But given the information we have now, there's no way we expect to see ""Pyongyang"" in Scotland.

Hallucinogenic mushrooms have been discovered on the grounds of Buckingham Palace in London — which is home to Britain's Queen Elizabeth. Celebrity gardener Alan Titchmarsh spotted the red-and-white fly agaric — also known as Amanita muscaria — while filming a program for U.K. broadcaster ITV that will be aired on Christmas Day.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace confirmed the find. ""There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms,"" he said. The fungi are beneficial to trees and help them take in nutrients, he added.

Tan Shen said that she was ""walking around feeling miserable"" when she passed the KFC restaurant in the city's train station.

She told local media: ""I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

""I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.""

She telephoned her employers to say that she was sick, and was unable to go to work.

And so she settled in.

After a few days employees at the chicken shop noticed that the same woman was still there.

""We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. At first no one really noticed her,"" said Jiang Li Lung, 22.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was OK, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

Miss Tan decided that it was time to leave the restaurant when, after a week, local media begun to write about her.

So she telephoned her employer, said that she had decided to leave her job, and took a train to her parents home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province.

1226,"Though Christian Bale was in final talks to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming biopic, the actor has reportedly decided to pass on the part, as he allegedly did not feel he was the right person to play the iconic figure on film.

Citing unnamed sources, The Hollywood Reporter revealed on Monday that Bale, an Academy Award winning actor, has exited the project. No potential replacements were named, though director Danny Boyle, himself an Oscar winner as well, is in Hollywood to meet with actors for the movie.

""Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw,"" the report said.

Bale is the second high-profile actor to circle the project, only to ultimately exit. Previously, Leonardo DiCaprio was targeted for the part, but he reportedly passed on the role earlier this month.

Previous names suggested for the part included Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper. The anticipated film has had a number of issues in production, as director David Fincher also abandoned the project after demanding $10 million in upfront payment and full control over marketing.

The only person confirmed to be onboard is Oscar winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who has penned the screenplay based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The movie is said to feature three scenes leading up to Jobs's introduction of key product unveilings: the original Mac, NeXT, and the iPod.

Last week it was said that actor Seth Rogan was in final talks to play the role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. It's unclear if Bale's exit from the picture might have an effect on other actors linked to the project."

1233,"BALAD, Iraq — Dizzy, vomiting and struggling to breathe, 11 Iraqi police officers were rushed to a government hospital 50 miles north of the capital last month. The diagnosis: poisoning by chlorine gas. The perpetrators, according to the officers: Islamic State extremists.

The chlorine attack appears to be the first confirmed use of chemical weapons by the Islamic State on the battlefield. An Iraqi Defense Ministry official corroborated it, and doctors said survivors’ symptoms were consistent with chlorine poisoning.

It is one of three crude chlorine attacks that Iraqi forces say have occurred since the extremists seized vast tracts of Iraqi territory this summer, although details on the other two incidents remain sketchy. The reported assaults raise concerns that the militants are attempting to hone their chemical weapons capabilities as they push to seize more ground.

The presence of a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant in territory seized by the Islamic State has compounded those fears, though officials and chemical weapons experts say the 2,500 degraded rockets filled with nerve agents that remain there are unlikely to be fit for use. Weapons inspectors sealed them off with concrete in a bunker more than 20 years ago.

The Islamic State’s reported chlorine attacks appear to have been largely ineffectual. The attack on the police officers last month is the only one officially documented.

Chlorine, a common component in industry, is sold legally, but its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was widely employed in trench warfare during World War I, including infamously at Ypres in Belgium, where German forces dispersed more than 160 tons of chlorine into the breeze, killing thousands of French and Allied soldiers.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said last month that chlorine gas has been used “systematically” as a weapon in villages in northern Syria. The U.S. government has blamed those attacks on the Syrian government. But it has been years since the chemical has been used in fighting in Iraq.

It was 4:20 p.m. on Sept. 15 when the 11 police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes.

“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, the hospital’s director. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”

The men had been brought in from the front lines of the nearby town of Duluiyah. Tucked into a bend of the Tigris River, the town had been under heavy assault for days, according to the accounts of three survivors. Islamic State fighters had taken territory to the north, cutting the only direct land access to the river town, and had blown up the last bridge into the town.

The police officers, all members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, which has turned against the Islamic State, were guarding a line in the town’s north. After an exchange of fire, they said, they were surprised to see Islamic State fighters retreating from their position about 150 yards away.

Suddenly there was a boom in the area the extremists had just vacated, said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, one of the survivors. “It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,” he said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. The men say it hung close to the ground, consistent with the properties of chlorine gas, which is heavier than air.

“I felt suffocated,” Jabbouri recalled. “I was throwing up and couldn’t breathe.”

Another officer, Ammer Jassim Mohammed, 31, who suffers from asthma, said he passed out within minutes.

The men were taken to a small clinic in Duluiyah, before being transferred by boat to the larger hospital in Balad, where they were treated with oxygen and hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory medication, until the symptoms began to subside. They were all discharged the following morning.

The four physicians who treated them said there was no question that chlorine gas was to blame.

One physician on the team, Hassanain Mohammed, had treated similar cases before. In 2006 and 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later morphed into the Islamic State, carried out a string of chlorine bombings in the country.

Mohammed was on duty at a Baghdad hospital one day during that period when dozens of victims were brought in after a bombing in Taji district, just north of the capital, in which insurgents had packed a truck with explosives and two one-ton chlorine tanks.

There have been no confirmed accounts of the use of chlorine gas as a weapon in Iraq since then.

An Iraqi Defense Ministry official confirmed this week that a bomb rigged with chlorine canisters was used in the Duluiyah attack.

“They use it just to create terror,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide the information publicly. “But of course we are very concerned.”

In a statement, the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Islamic State has used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” near water treatment plants where it has gained access to chlorine, as well as in roadside bomb attacks. It did not specify the locations of the attacks, but there are several water plants near Duluiyah on territory controlled by the Islamic State.

The extremist group aims to dent “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular,” the statement said.

It said that soldiers should be provided with gas masks as a precaution and that volunteers and civilians should place a dampened cloth over the nose and mouth to protect themselves during any attacks.

The defense official said he did not have details of any incidents other than the Sept. 15 attack, while a U.S. official said he had no reports of the use of chlorine by the Islamic State.

“We aren’t aware of any chlorine attacks against the [Iraqi security forces] but would refer you to the Iraqi government to see what they might have,” said Army Maj. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for Florida-based U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. security interests in the Middle East.

Chlorine bombs are an easy-to-create but inexact weapon, experts say. All that is needed is a small explosive charge to rupture containers filled with the substance.

“It’s difficult to deliver on target in combat situations,” said Jean Pascal Zanders, an independent researcher who specializes in chemical and biological weapons and disarmament. “Chlorine dissipates fast unless someone is able to concentrate it in a confined area.”

Fighters in Duluiyah say it was not the only time chlorine has been used against them. Another attack this month caused minor injuries, and the fighters were treated locally, police officials said.

Immediately after the September attack, the Balad hospital put in orders for thousands of doses of atropine, used to treat nerve-gas exposure, Hatim said. A thousand have been shipped across the river to Duluiyah.

Soldiers who escaped an Islamic State rout of a besieged army base in Saqlawiyah, where hundreds of soldiers were killed last month, also said chlorine gas was used there — though reports of where and how the gas was delivered varied and could not be confirmed.

While some officers said air-fired canisters fell short of the base, others, who claimed to have remained in the installation for a longer period, said they fell within its perimeter.

“It was chaos,” said Capt. Ahmed Hussein. He said he believed that gas canisters were fired into the camp but pointed out that the situation was highly confused. “I saw an explosion and smelled the smell; it was like bleach,” he said. “I was far enough away, but others were affected and were left behind.”

Ammar Toma, a member of parliament’s defense and security committee, said it had received photographs from officers of the projectiles used in the Saqlawiyah area.

“We aren’t sure chlorine was used,” he said. “But we believe it was either chlorine or another chemical.”

1234,"In a sprawling Facebook post and subsequent interview with Radar Online, a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a number of fascinating claims about herself and her alleged relationship with Michael Phelps. Among them: she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, met the Olympic swimmer on Tinder, and fucked said Olympic swimmer on their first date watching football on TV.

""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. ""Here is the truth.""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.

Citing an anonymous tipster (that could very well have been Chandler herself), The Hollywood Gossip previously named Chandler as Michael Phelps' companion the night of his latest DUI, a claim repeated in her recent Facebook post.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.

Today, Chandler followed up her announcement by giving Radar Online additional details of her supposed first date with Phelps after meeting him on Tinder, which involved watching a Baltimore Ravens game at the athlete's home. ""One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,"" Chandler told the site. ""Later, we had sex again.""

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the ""threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""

I am telling my story to take the power away from the media and tabloids that want to hurt Michael and I. I will probably lose him, which hurts like hell.

And to add some more fun to this, director Zack Snyder tweeted a photo of the culprit. Hint: Snyder is currently in a twitter war with this movie. Hit the jump to check it out.
So there you have it, it was nothing more than a publicity stunt created by social media. It also a great way to market both films, but more importantly we get to see more of the Batmobile.
Now it’s Bad Robot or Disney’s move. The rivalry all started back last July when Snyder tweeted a shot of Superman (Henry Cavill) donning a Sith robe while wielding a red lightsaber. The director added the #superjedi to rub some salt on the wound.
Of course then Bad Robot responded with the following tweet. They even called out the Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice director with “The C3Ped Crusader“:"

1249,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua’s government said Sunday that a loud boom heard overnight by residents of the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near the city’s airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event confirmed it was a “relatively small” meteorite that “appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.”

Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 12 meters (39 feet) and a depth of 5 meters (16 feet), said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

“It could have come off that asteroid, because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was “very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.”

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn’t see anything strange in the sky.

“I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,” Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua’s international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it.

1252,"A second patient with Ebola symptoms walked into a Texas clinic today and told medics he had been in contact with first victim Thomas Duncan.

The CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas was placed in lock-down after the person appeared on Wednesday and was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus.

The patient answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to West Africa and is said to have contact with Duncan, referred to as ‘patient zero’.

Mr Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday morning at Texas Presbyterian Hospital after developing symptoms of the disease almost two weeks ago.

The person exhibiting Ebola symptoms today claimed to have had contact with Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, who died from the virus on Wednesday morning

A patient attended CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas today and was rushed to a nearby hospital after presenting with Ebola symptoms

It is not yet clear how the patient came in alleged contact with Mr Duncan or if he is among the 48 people being monitored for the deadly virus by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The Frisco patient was rushed to a nearby hospital by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on Main Street, CBS confirmed.

Medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30pm to request an ambulance for the patient.

The clinic was keeping everyone at the center until they are checked out by the CDC - it is unknown how many people were exposed to the patient.

The CDC will host a press conference at 4pm (ET) to update the public and the media, the White House announced just minutes after the existence of a second Ebola patient was reported.

Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian national, exposed nearly 50 people to the disease in America before he was put in isolation at Texas Presbyterian.

His fiancee Louise Troh is currently in quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two nephews and under constant monitoring by health officials over fears that they, too, could develop symptoms during a 21-day incubation period.

Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Duncan after he became contagious.

Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease.

Duncan's fiancee Louise Troh, who is perhaps highest at risk of catching the disease after she cared for him at her Dallas apartment while he sweated and vomited through the early staged of the disease, says she does not blame him for possibly exposing her.

The White House said on Wednesday that extra screening for fever will be carried out for arriving aircraft passengers from West Africa, where the virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in three countries.

The screening will start at New York's John F. Kennedy airport from the weekend, and later at Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta.

1253,"The United States Department of Defense said on Tuesday that it is “not out of the realm of the possible” that some of the weapons and ammunitions airdropped by the U.S. military near Kobani had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State group. Earlier on Tuesday, the militant group released a video showing a cache of weapons, apparently dropped by the U.S., in their possession.

“They are certainly of the kinds of material that was dropped,” Pentagon spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said on Tuesday, referring to the weapons showed in the ISIS video. “We’re taking a look at this…and when we have something definitive that we can provide in terms of an assessment on that, we'll do that.”

Kirby, however, added that he is “very confident” that most of the airdropped weapons had reached the Kurds battling the Islamic State group in Kobani. “In fact, we're only aware of one bundle that did not,” Kirby said.

The video released by the Islamic State group shows a large consignment of packages containing hand grenades and rounds for small rockets wrapped in clear plastic attached to parachute cords. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that ISIS had seized at least one cache of weapons meant for the Kurds, according to media reports.

The U.S. military had delivered nearly 30 packages containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies on Sunday, in an attempt to “enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobani,” according to a statement by the United States Central Command, or CENTCOM, released Sunday.

Redur Xelil, a spokesperson for the YPG, a Kurdish militia, had confirmed on Monday that Kurdish fighters had received the weapons, and said that they would “help greatly” in the battle against the Islamic State group in Kobani, according to an Al Jazeera report.

The situation in the Syrian border town, meanwhile, continues to remain “tenuous,” Kirby said on Tuesday.

“We do assess that Kurdish forces in the city are in control of the majority of the city. I would hesitate to put a number figure on that, but we do believe that they are in possession of the majority of it,” he said, adding that the U.S.-led coalition had continued to conduct airstrikes in the region."
1254,"The Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been killed as has been previously claimed. He is wounded and being treated in the border area of Iraq and Syria.

A few days ago, it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed by a U.S. airstrike near Mosul in Northern Iraq, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

However, a source told Iraqi media that the IS leader and self-proclaimed Caliph has not been killed, but is badly injured as a result of the recent US airstrikes near the Tel Afer and Sinjar areas.

“This is the second time al-Baghdadi has been injured in the last two months and right now he is being treated in a Syrian location close to the Iraqi border,” the source told Iraqi newspaper al-Sabah.

When it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed, the Pentagon did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users shared an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body.

However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did later say that any IS leaders “inside troop formations are likely to be killed.”"
1255,"The CBI registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 men

The CBI has registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 of his followers.

The agency has registered a case of criminal conspiracy against the Dera chief and his other followers for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, among other charges, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) .

The case has been registered on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

A petition was filed in the high court in 2012 by a follower of Dera demanding a CBI inquiry and compensation for his alleged castration in 2000, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said.

Prasad added that petitioner Hansraj Chauhan has alleged that around 400 male devotees, including himself, belonging to Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, were castrated at the Dera after its head (Ram Rahim) falsely claimed that the castration would lead to “realisation of God through him”.

Justice K. Kannan of the high court passed the order on the petition ordering a CBI inquiry into the incident.

The court had earlier ordered a medical examination of the petitioner from the government multi-speciality hospital which found that he had indeed been castrated.

In a report submitted before the HC, the state government had said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons associated with the Dera head and all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated."
1256,"The Pentagon has confirmed that Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab, was killed in a US air strike earlier this week.

The United States previously said that the strike inside Somalia had targeted Godane, but did not know whether he had been killed.

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al-Shabaab, has been killed,” said rear admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, describing it as a “major symbolic and operational loss” for the militant group, which aligned itself with al-Qaida.

Al-Shabaab is fighting to topple Somalia’s western-backed government and regularly launches bombings and gun attacks against state targets and civilians. Godane’s death could now lead to an internal power struggle.

On Wednesday US officials had said they were still investigating to see whether the strike on an al-Shabaab encampment had killed Godane, 37, who reportedly trained with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At least three strikes hit a convoy of al-Shabaab vehicles in southern Somalia on Monday night, according to witnesses and a spokesman for the group who spoke later with the Associated Press. The al-Shabaab representative said that six al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the strikes.

The air raid came days after African Union (AU) troops and Somali government forces launched “Operation Indian Ocean”, a major offensive aimed at seizing key ports from al-Shabaab and cutting off one of their key sources of revenue: multi-million dollar exports of charcoal. AU forces were targeting Shabaab on several fronts, with Ugandan troops leading the offensives against the main port of Barawe, south of the capital, Mogadishu.

The commander of the AU in Somalia has said the death of Godane would be a “proud and happy moment for all Africa”.

Godane, who has a passion for poetry, seized world attention a year ago with the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, which left at least 67 dead. He warned Kenya that it would suffer further atrocities unless it withdrew its troops from the AU force in Somalia.

“You cannot withstand a war of attrition inside your own country,” he said in an audio message posted on a website linked to al-Shabaab. “So withdraw all your forces, or be prepared for an abundance of blood that will be spilt in your country.”

Washington has carried out a series of drone missile strikes in the past, including attacks reportedly targeting Godane, but rarely confirms this officially.

Godane took over the leadership of al-Shabaab in 2008 after then chief Adan Hashi Ayro was killed by a US missile strike.

Also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, Godane was al-Shabaab’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida. In 2012 the US offered a reward of up to $7m (£4.2m) for information leading to his arrest."

The presenter found the red and white spotted toadstool called Amanita muscaria while filming an ITV gardening show called The Queen's Garden and said: 'I won't be eating any of that.'

He was touring the private 40-acre site with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley and asked him whether the fungus is edible.

Professor Crawley replied saying: 'That depends what you mean. It's eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

'The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.'

Titchmarsh jokingly replied: 'I think I'll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.'

The fungus, also known as fly agaric, contains the psychoactive chemicals ibotenic acid and muscimol and they can be found throughout the UK.

Last night a Palace spokesman was keen to point out the fungus is not served to Royals.

He said: 'There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

'As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients.'

He told the Sun: 'For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.'

This type of fungus can often be found growing under birch or pine trees, especially Monterey and Bishop pine which are common in the garden at Buckingham Palace.

With permission from Her Majesty The Queen, Alan Titchmarsh spent a whole year exploring the Buckingham Palace Garden, which has a five-century history.

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He said: 'Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.'

During her reign, Her Majesty has made the garden a place where nature thrives. It now plays host to 350 species of wildflower, 83 species of bird and two and a half thousand British species of insect, including butterflies.

It's been the garden of Queen Elizabeth II for longer than any other monarch. A rare film from 1937 shows the Queen as an 11-year-old princess with her younger sister princess Margaret, having just moved into the palace.

Mr Titchmarsh heard tales about the Queen's childhood from royal historian Dr Lucy Worsley, who explains that the young princesses held a wistful fascination with what was beyond the garden walls.

Amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric, can cause vivid hallucinations

Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture.

The white-spotted, usually red mushroom is viewed as the quintessential toadstool and can be found throughout Europe and America, often growing under birch and pine trees.

The fungus is well-known for its hallucinogenic properties because it has a high level of a psycoactive agent called muscimol.

Historically the mushrooms were used by medicine men or ‘shamans’ of north east Asia.

There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in Siberia, the Middle East, India, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.

Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects as they can change dramatically depending on the habitat and the amount ingested per body weight.

Effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions and mood swings.

It can cause vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. Some users report having spiritual experiences.

The fungi are often considered poisonous and a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps.

With ongoing outrage over the NFL's recent slew of scandals, it made perfect sense when ESPN announced it will hold a panel on domestic violence Monday night. But as the two organizations geared up this discussion about women and abuse in the world of sports, it quickly became painfully clear that women had been completely excluded from the table. 

As Esquire's Ben Collins pointed out last week, the panel will consist entirely of male commentators, while female reporters will be literally sidelined in the discussion.

""Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24,"" Collins wrote.

""When the show has updates from the field — brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game — they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.""

What an oversight. The utter failure to include a single woman in a discussion about domestic violence has already attracted a ton of criticism online:






But that's not all. While it might be easy to dismiss an incident like this as unintentional, Collins rightly points out that ESPN's track record on holding the NFL accountable is not that great. And why should it be, given the lucrative, multibillion-dollar partnership the two organizations enjoy?

""You will not hear these words because ESPN is not a company in the business of journalism. It is an entertainment outlet that sometimes reports convenient, timely information to drive interest in future programming,"" Collins writes. ""There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimes — and ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.""

This scandal has given ESPN the chance to decide whether it wants to be an outlet for responsible sports journalism or a profit-driven hype man for the NFL. And we may already have the answer."

He said Mr. al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al-Dulaimi.

1266,"A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has reportedly issued a fatwa against building snowmen, arguing that the practice goes against Islamic teachings.

“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun,” declared Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid, Reuters reported.

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of man, an action considered sinful under the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, Reuters reported.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he reportedly wrote in his ruling.

No date was set for the implementation of the fatwa and there was no government comment, The Telegraph reported. Anyone trained in Islamic law can issue a fatwa, or formal legal opinion, based on their knowledge of the law."
1267,"BEIRUT — Lebanon’s military has detained a wife and child of the leader of the Islamic State, security officials said Tuesday.

The spouse of another senior Islamic State commander was also detained by the army, officials said. The women and child might be able to offer insights into the activities of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his inner circle. Or they could become bargaining chips for the release of hostages held by the militant group.

A Lebanese intelligence official identified Baghdadi’s wife as Sagia Dulaimi and said she was detained last week with her 9-year-old daughter at the Madfoun checkpoint in northern Lebanon.

Other media reports, including from the Associated Press, identified the child as a boy. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.

Baghdadi’s wife and child were carrying false identity papers after crossing from Syria, said the official, who was involved in interrogating the detainees. He said they were Syrian nationals, but other security officials said they could be Iraqi.

The pair were being held at a Defense Ministry compound on the outskirts of Beirut, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a lack of authority to discuss the issue on the record.

The second woman is of Chechen origin, said a Lebanese military official. The official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to give her identity or the name of her husband.

It was not immediately clear whether the woman was detained at the same time as the wife and child of Baghdadi, an Iraqi whose real name is Ibrahim al-Samarrai.

It also remains uncertain why the detainees came to Lebanon, where the Islamic State, a radical al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIS or ISIL, is opposed by both the country’s Western-allied military and the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia.

The military official said a number of family members of Islamic State militants had taken refuge in northern Lebanon, where there are pockets of support from groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, or al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.

The three detainees could be used to bargain for the release of hostages held by the Islamic State, which has kidnapped thousands of people — including Arabs, Turks, Kurds, Europeans and Americans — to extract ransoms or punish those it considers guilty of religious transgressions. The militants also have beheaded captives, including two American journalists as well as American and British aid workers — in response to airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition, the Islamic State has said.

The intelligence official said Dulaimi was part of a prisoner swap this year between the Syrian government and rebels in Maaloula, a city in Syria. The government of Bashar al-Assad agreed to release 150 prisoners in exchange for Greek Orthodox nuns who are believed to have been held by militants with links to groups such as al-Qaeda.

In August, militants sympathetic to the Islamic State attacked the northern Lebanese town of Arsal and captured more than 20 soldiers before withdrawing. They have since beheaded two of the soldiers, demanding that Lebanon release a number of jihadists it has jailed.

The Lebanese daily As-Safir was first to report on the detentions of Baghdadi’s wife and child, whom it identified as a son. The paper added that the arrests were made in “coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.”

After lightning advances in Iraq this year by the Islamic State, Baghdadi declared a caliphate on land under the group’s control, which extends from deep inside Iraq to northern Syria.

It is unclear how many wives Baghdadi has, although Islamic law generally allows four.

Meanwhile, at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed by gunmen in an ambush in a border area Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a security official. Details on the assailants were not immediately known, but there have been previous clashes near the Syrian border involving security forces and militant groups including Jabhat al-Nusra.

1268,"Vice Media CEO and co-founder Shane Smith, whose billion-dollar company was accused of underpaying its employees earlier this year, spent $300,000 on dinner at a Las Vegas hotel last month.
MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal in January.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the guest was Smith, citing an anonymous source who attended the private feast at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse.


MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg in an e-mail that it was a party of 12. But one of the guests at the dinner estimated it to be a party of closer to 25.

The majority of the bill was spent on wine, with some bottles costing $20,000, Dumont said.

Smith was in town attending the Consumer Electronics Show, and had a very successful run at the blackjack table prior to the meal.

David Carr, the New York Times columnist who died unexpectedly last week at age 58, hinted at Smith’s hot hand in a pair of tweets last month.



“No brainer quiz,” Carr tweeted. “What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”

Carr and Smith famously clashed when Carr interviewed some Vice execs for the 2011 documentary, “Page One.”

The legendary New York Times media critic put Smith in his place when Smith criticized the Times for what he thought was a lack of coverage in genocide-stricken areas like Africa.


“Before you ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide,” Carr told Smith. “Just because you put on a f***ing safari helmet and looked at some poop doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.”

In May, a Gawker report accused Vice of paying its employees lowly wages, citing salary numbers provided by anonymous former Vice staffers.

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" the report said. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

One former Vice editorial employee told Gawker that Smith was a ""jackass” who “makes an insane amount of money” as the public figurehead of the company.

Vice responded to the allegations by pointing out that former Gawker interns had brought a class-action lawsuit against the company’s founder, Nick Denton, for allegedly violating federal wage laws.

Then, at the Vice company holiday party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to $1 million total, Business Insider reported.

1269,"JJ Abrams is considering releasing his heavily anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens this summer, according to unconfirmed reports from Ikwiz and Movie Pilot. The film has a current release date of December 18 2015.

According to Movie Pilot, the director is losing patience with the constant stream of plot and image leaks from the Star Wars set, and believes that shifting to an earlier release date will mean the film isn't ""ruined"" before fans can see it. The Ikwiz article states: ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

While neither website has an official source for the rumour, Abrams is reported to have made the comments at the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards on February 4. The director received the VES Visionary Award during the ceremony.

Last week, Disney appeared to be cracking down on anyone illegally leaking content from Star Wars VII, requesting that a judge issue a subpoena to a website named ImageShack, which was hosting a blurred image of a Sith Lord clutching a red lightsaber – said to be a leaked still from the film. In a declaration to support the issuance of a subpoena, a Disney employee confirmed the image was related to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

1271,"Axl Rose is not dead, despite internet reports to the contrary — but that should come as no surprise to fans who by now have surely grown tired of the seemingly endless stream of online hoaxes falsely reporting the death of just about every major celebrity, and plenty of minor celebs as well.

The Axl Rose death hoax started on a bogus site forged to look like a page on the MSNBC website. The authentic looking — at a cursory glance, anyway — story was headlined, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52,” and claimed that the “Welcome To The Jungle” singer was found dead after police were called to check on the former rock star’s welfare.

Perhaps in a vain attempt to add an air of authenticity to the latest death hoax, the phony story on the ersatz MSNBC site claimed the death of Axl Rose remained “unconfirmed.”

“It’s fake, dude,” wrote the site Mediaite, in its story mocking the Axl Rose death hoax. “You can go ahead and confirm it.”

The site Gossip Cop, which specializes in debunking rumors about celebrities — dead or alive — was among the first to expose the fakery, which apparently fooled numerous internet users with its convincing-looking URL, “msnbc.website.”

“The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories,” reported Gossip Cop. “Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website.”

In addition to Home Alone star Culkin, and today’s hogwash “Axl Rose is dead” prank, other celebrities victimized by death hoaxes recently have included “Dog Whisperer” Cesar Millan, ’80s “Brat Pack” actor Judd Nelson, and TV Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno.

While Axl Rose and his representatives have not confirmed that the “Paradise City” crooner is actually still living and breathing, but they probably don’t need to. But one thing is certain. Axl Rose may be the latest, but will certainly not be the last “dead” but-not-really celebrity to be the subject of a yet another tiresome online death hoax."
1273,"WOBURN, Mass. (AP) — A 113-year-old, shoebox-sized time capsule was removed Thursday from the head of a lion statue where it had long sat, hidden in plain sight, atop one of Boston's most famous landmarks.

When the copper box was carefully pried open, it revealed at least one mystery: a red, hardcover book with no visible title or markings. The contents of the book — and the rest of the items in the box — will remain a mystery for a bit longer, as they were deemed too fragile to remove immediately.

The time capsule's presence at the Old State House had only recently been confirmed. The Bostonian Society, which oversees the building, had expected it to contain a potpourri of photographs and newspaper clippings from the period, along with a missive to future generations penned by a group of Boston journalists.

""I'm absolutely delighted by the conditions inside the box,"" said Brian LeMay, the society's president, noting little sign of mold or water damage. Historians had feared the contents could have been destroyed had the box been improperly sealed.

The time capsule was placed inside the lion's head in 1901 and then forgotten, even as waves of tourists visited the building that once served as a fulcrum of British rule in the northern colonies and later as the first seat of Massachusetts state government.

In 1770, British soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside the building, killing five in what came to be known as the Boston Massacre.

The society first learned of the possible existence of the time capsule three years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on renovations to the building and was believed to have placed the box in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box ""which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.""

The box was removed Thursday by Robert Shure, president of Skylight Studios in suburban Woburn, where the copper and gold-leaf lion statue had been brought for refurbishing.

Shure placed the box on a table and used a drill and other tools to cut it open. The bright red book was the first object seen inside.

Elizabeth Roscio, archivist for the Bostonian Society, speculated that the book could be a Rogers' family history, but LeMay was less certain.

""I'm as anxious as anyone in this room to just grab it and look inside,"" he said. But Roscio explained that to avoid possible damage, the contents must be removed and examined in a temperature-controlled setting. They could go on public display at the Old State House later this year.

In accepting the gift from the past, the society has also decided to leave one for the future.

A new time capsule, made of titanium, will be inserted back into the head of the lion. Suggestions on what to include are still being solicited, LeMay said, but one item will be a medal from the 2013 Boston Marathon, a symbol to future generations of the city's resiliency in the face of tragedy."
1274,"WASHINGTON (WJLA) -- The White House intruder who jumped a fence and made it inside the White House just over a week ago overtook a Secret Service agent and managed to run into the East Room, which is often used for presidential addresses, the Washington Post reported Monday.

Several sources gave the Post a new account of the case involving Omar Gonzalez, an Iraq veteran said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
The previous account from the Secret Service claimed Gonzalez was quickly apprehended after he made it inside the front door to the White House. But the Post's report indicates Gonzalez made it much further inside than previously known.
The Post report also provided first word that Gonzalez, who authorities said was armed with a knife, actually overpowered a Secret Service agent before running throughout much of the main floor.
Sources also told the Post that an alarm box designed to alert guards to an intruder had apparently been muted, which may have contributed to Gonzalez being able to burst through the front door so easily.
The Secret Service declined to comment to the Post because the security breach remains under ongoing investigation."
1277,"When Apple unveiled its first smartwatch earlier this month, the company told us a lot about its design, customization options, and the type of features we can expect. What we didn't hear about, however, is the technology Apple will use to power the watch.

Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri spoke with Apple's supply chain to learn that the Apple Watch will most likely come in two different storage capacities: 4GB and 8GB. Arcuri revealed this information in a note to investors, according to Apple Insider.

Arcuri believes the 4GB edition will be the more popular mainstream version, noting that the 8GB watch probably won't be the default configuration. This means you'll be able to store apps, messages, fitness data, and other types of files and information directly on the watch.

That amount of storage space is fairly standard for smartwatches. Both Samsung's Gear 2 and Sony's Smartwatch 3 also come with 4GB of storage space. This means that if Apple does release an 8GB version, it'll offer twice as much storage as current smartwatches.

Arcuri's supply chain sources also said the wireless chip inside Apple's watch would come with a GPS radio, which is odd given that Apple said its watch would need to be connected to an iPhone to use GPS data. This chip will reportedly be similar to the wireless chip found inside the iPhone 5s, Arcuri wrote.

The Apple Watch won't be released until early 2015, so we expect to learn more about it over the next several months.

1278,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has a plan to boost the readership of The Washington Post, which he bought last year for $250 million.

Amazon's newest line of high-end Kindle Fire HDX tablets will come pre-installed with an app curating Post news and photography, Brad Stone reports for Bloomberg.

The app will be free, at least at first, and will also be available to download on other devices, though with a monthly subscription fee.

The effort is reportedly called ""Project Rainbow"" internally, and marks Bezos' first move to create ties between the newspaper and Amazon.

The initiative is being led by the former editor in chief of Salon, Kerry Lauerman, who was one of many new hires brought on since Bezos took charge.

As Stone points out, this move would not only get the Post to more readers, but also potentially make the Kindle Fire HDX tablet more attractive to buyers. Amazon has made a huge bet on original content, like television shows and video games, to add value to its devices through its subscription service, Amazon Prime, and adding Washington Post's news could align with those efforts.

1280,"Would you pay five grand for the high-end luxury edition of the Apple Watch? That's the starting price that Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster sees in his crystal ball.

On March 9, Apple is expected to finally unveil the finer details of its Apple Watch, including the price tags and launch date. The company's first smartwatch will be available in three versions: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. Apple has already revealed that the entry-level Sport model will start at $349 in the US. But the company has been mum about the prices of the other two models.

In an investors note released late Monday, Munster said he expects that the price for the Sport model could reach as high as $450 depending on different case and storage options. The mid-tier Apple Watch could start at anywhere from $499 to $549 and likely will come closer to an average selling price of $650, according to Munster. But the top-of-the-line Apple Watch Edition could break the bank, starting at $4,999 and potentially reaching closer to $7,500 by factoring in high-end, expensive bands.

That $4,999 price lines up with a projection from Apple observer John Gruber, who forecast the cost of the high-end version last September.

Apple is a latecomer to a smartwatch market already crowded with entries from Samsung, LG, Motorola, Microsoft, Sony, Pebble and other players. Apple's product will be part smartwatch and part fitness and activity tracker, a combination the company is counting on to bring in buyers. But by offering the watch in a luxury edition, Apple is also presenting it as a piece of fine jewelry to further distinguish it from rival products.

Munster remains bearish on Apple Watch sales, estimating 8 million in unit sales this year, compared with Wall Street forecasts of 14 million. But the analyst believes next Monday's event ""will finally highlight the special features of the watch and start to excite the public.""

Apple will offer interchangeable bands for each of its watches, a factor that will determine the ultimate price. Munster said he believes the elastomer bands for the Apple Watch Sport will range in price from $29 to $39. Leather bands could be priced from $49 to $59. Steel bands could run around $99. And the gold bands for the higher-end edition may run into the thousands of dollars.

How might the three different versions of the watch play out in terms of sales? Munster said he expects the entry-level Sport edition to account for around 55 percent of all units sold this year, while the Apple Watch will contribute around 45 percent. That leaves the luxury Apple Watch Edition contributing pretty much nothing, at least in terms of percentage.

""The Apple Watch Edition is the more difficult to predict, but we believe that with the watch likely starting at $4,999, Apple might sell around 10,000 units in CY15 [calendar year 2015] of our total 8 million estimate, Munster said. ""To put the 10k units in perspective, Piper analyst Erinn Murphy, in conjunction with industry estimates, believes that Rolex sells 600-750K watches per year, thus Apple at 10K in the first year would be about 2 percent the size of Rolex. We believe this is a reasonable potential first year size as high-end consumers weigh the power of the Apple brand vs. other luxury watches and the trade-off of quickly depreciating technology in an Apple Watch vs. other more traditional luxury watches that may hold value better.""

A spokeswoman for Apple said the company had no comment at this time."
1281,"On Thursday evening, thousands of people took to Twitter to share the #MacklemoreJoinedISS, mercilessly trolling the 9/11 truther based on a bogus tweet.

No, Macklemore has not joined the ranks of ISIS.

While the notorious Syria-based terrorist organization has allegedly recruited the likes of Deso Dogg, a Berlin gangsta rapper who’s popped up in a handful of ISIS beheading videos—and is reportedly being used as a recruitment tool—the mild-mannered “Thrift Shop” rapper has not followed suit.

On Thursday evening, the #MacklemoreJoinedISIS became the top trending topic on Twitter worldwide based on the strength of a bogus tweet that was circulated (and retweeted, and retweeted) through the Twitterverse, eventually going viral.

Behold:

horrified at news that macklemore has joined ISIS #MacklemoreJoinedISIS pic.twitter.com/N3PJO0ciWV

The 31-year-old Grammy Award-winning rapper—and recent father—formerly known as Ben Haggerty has supported a number of progressive social causes, including marching in Ferguson protests in his native Seattle and having a bunch of gay couples be married (by Madonna, no less) during his Grammys performance of “Same Love.”

On the opposite end of the sociopolitical spectrum, he's also a 9/11 truther who, on the track “Bush Song” off his 2005 EP The Language of My World, rapped the following: “Where’s Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq / Findin’ some oil to tap, tell ’em I got up on that / And y’all still think it was bin Laden / When it was us and the Masons, plottin’ on oil profits.” The 30-year-old followed those bars up with the following tweet, which he unleashed in 2009:

911...bush knocked down the towers

And back in May, Macklemore took it upon himself to dress up as an anti-Semitic Jewish caricature, sporting a giant prosthetic hooked nose, dark beard, and bowl cut wig, during a surprise performance at Seattle’s Experience Music Project.

The Twitter world, including actor Seth Rogen (who is Jewish), was not amused:

The rumor from iGen.fr claims that Cook was speaking to employees at a retail store in Berlin where he told them that the wears his Apple Watch everywhere, “even in the shower.”
It should be kept in mind though that when the Apple Watch was unveiled last year the company had only said that the device was good for wearing in the rain, getting sweaty during a workout and washing hands. There was no mention of showers or swimming pools.
While it is possible that Apple has tweaked the watch enough that its now good for those tasks as well, one can’t discount the possibility that Cook might simply have been misheard, so we’ll really have to wait until the device arrives to find out just how resistant it is to water.

It was first posted on Reddit by user fryd_ first and informed parents the “urge to create is equally strong in all children: Boys and girls”.

Speaking to i100.co.uk, Emma Owen of Lego UK and Ireland said the letter was part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted at girls aged four and up from the 1970s.

Commenting on the message, fryd_ first said “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” in forty years but Lego disagree.

Emma Owens of Lego
The letter from 1974 in full:

To Parents

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

It’s not the first time an old message from Lego has gone viral. This 1981 advert from the company was aimed at all children and shared widely online in January 2014.

1293,"ISIS claimed Friday that a 26-year-old female American hostage was killed in an airstrike in Syria, according to NBC News partners Flashpoint Intelligence.

Defense officials told NBC News that U.S. military and military intelligence have no information to confirm ISIS' claim, and the State Department said it could not confirm reports of the death ""in any way.""

""We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports. We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL's claim,"" said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council said.

Kayla Mueller, originally from Arizona, was taken hostage by ISIS in Syria on Aug. 4, 2013, while leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital. Her family previously had requested Mueller's name not be made public for fear it would endanger her life.

According to a statement released by a representative of her family on Friday urging caution in reporting on Mueller's situation, ""the common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others.""

""Kayla has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,"" the statement added.

In a report distributed on Twitter, ISIS stated that Mueller was buried in the rubble of a building hit by Jordanian aircraft. Jordanian warplanes have pounded ISIS targets in Syria since the militants released a video that appeared to show a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage.

Jordan disputed the ISIS claim.

""ISIS is being illogical and they're lying,"" Mohammad Al Moumani, a spokesman for the information ministry, told NBC News. ""How do they know it's a Jordanian aircraft? What was a woman doing in their training center or weapons storage facility? Because those are what we're targeting.""

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said: ""I cannot confirm those reports in any way. Obviously people are looking into them, but cannot confirm them."" When asked if she knew if the hostage was alive, Harf said: ""We're just not going to get into specifics about Americans being held overseas.""

One senior defense official told NBC News ""the entire intel community"" in the U.S. government ""lit up immediately at the ISIS claim and is attempting to gather the facts."" The official also said that if, in fact, the American woman has been killed it could be impossible to verify if was the result of an airstrike.

Recently, President Barack Obama has said the U.S. is deploying ""all assets"" to save Mueller.

Kayla Mueller in an undated family photo.

Mueller's family previously had requested that her name not be made public, and little has been publicized about her ordeal.

Her interest in activism started young: she was recognized as a National Young Leader while in high school at Tri City College Prep in Prescott, Arizona, and won several volunteering awards. As a teen, she volunteered for the Save Darfur Coalition, writing letters and placing calls to members of Congress, according to her local paper. Mueller also later wrote about Darfur while at Northern Arizona University, penning a piece in the school paper, The Lumberjack.

After graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009, Mueller worked with humanitarian aid organizations in India, Israel and Palestine, according to the statement issued on behalf of her family. It said she returned home to Arizona in 2011 and spent a year working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women's shelter before traveling to France to work as an au pair and study the French language.

Sometime that year, Mueller uploaded a video to YouTube expressing solidarity with the Syrian people. While she initially studied French with the intention of working in Africa, according to the family representatives, Mueller instead went to the Turkish-Syrian border to work with Syrian refugees in December 2012.

Mueller spoke of her experiences in Syria at her local Kiwanis club in May 2013, saying that she is often asked — once people learn she is American — ""where is the world"" by desperate refugees.

""All I can do is cry with them, because I don't know,"" she said, according to an article on the event in her local paper. ""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. (I will not let this be) something we just accept.""

She worked in Turkey with the Danish Refugee Council and the ""Support to Life"" humanitarian aid organization to assist refugees. When Mueller was taken captive in Aleppo, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2013, she was leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital.

Kayla Mueller, left, with her mother Marsha Mueller in undated family photo.

""Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she is extremely devoted to the people of Syria,"" her family said in the statement released Friday.

ISIS first made contact with Mueller's family in May 2014 confirming the young woman was being held captive and providing proof of life, the statement added.

ISIS demanded a $6.6 million ransom for her freedom, and/or the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist convicted of attempted murder by a New York federal court in 2010.

Following the claims from ISIS about Mueller's death on Friday, former ISIS hostage Nicolas Henin posted on Twitter that ""Kayla Mueller was among the very last of my former cellmates still detained.""

""I was full of hope she could have a way out,"" he added.

1294,"Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, has allegedly taken over state duties while her brother receives medical treatment. Her responsibilities include handling important government decisions while her brother undergoes treatment at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang, according to media reports. No specific information on his alleged health troubles have been made public.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" said Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, according to the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo.

Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. She was only officially mentioned for the first time on March 9 and was later identified as a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, according to Ria Novosti, the Russian news agency.

The Associated Press reported earlier this month on the supreme leader's notable absence from a Supreme People’s Assembly meeting broadcast on state television, apparently the first time he's missed the meeting since taking office in December 2011 after the sudden death of his father and predecessor. North Korean state media has acknowledged rumors of illness by saying that the 31-year-old leader was experiencing “discomfort,” without going into further detail.

Media reports have speculated that he has gout, underwent ankle surgery, or is suffering from health problems after eating too much cheese."
1295,"A Canadian-Israeli woman who was feared kidnapped by the Islamic State over the weekend appears to have posted a message on Facebook debunking reports of her capture.

Gill Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on Monday that she is ""safe and secure.""

Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper also reported earlier on Monday that Kurdish media carried unverified statements from Rosenberg, in which she stated that she was fine.

A former IDF soldier who joined up with Kurdish militias to fight against the Islamic State, Rosenberg had been the subject of a Canadian government inquiry after rumors circulated on jihadist forums over the weekend that she had been taken prisoner in the Syrian town of Kobani.

The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the 31-year-old from White Rock, a suburb of Vancouver, served two years in the Israeli army. While in Israel in 2009 she was arrested as part of an international fraud ring and brought to the United States to serve time in jail. Haaretz reports that in the years since, Rosenberg began contacting Kurdish militias via the internet, before traveling to Iraq and Syria to fight alongside them against the extremist militants."
1296,"TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”

“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”

“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.

In Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”

In Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”"
1298,"A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 school girls kidnapped by the militants six months ago. That was not the case.
 
At least 25 suspected Boko Haram militants were killed as they battled with Nigerian soldiers on Monday, following a ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Islamists in the lawless northern region.
An army officer, speaking anonymously, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but that soldiers had fought them off.
""Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,"" the officer said.
Damboa, near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by a military counter-offensive.
Ceasefire 'incomplete'
The Borno Elders Forum, made up of retired Nigerian civilian and military officials from the Borno state, said attacks in recent days indicated that not all Boko Haram fighters were aware of the deal.
""I don't think they would continue attacking innocent people if they are aware and they are in agreement that there is a ceasefire,"" said spokesman Bulama Mali Gubio.
The Borno Elders Forum, which last month warned that Boko Haram was preparing preparing to take over key sites in Borno, suggested the government had not negotiated with the entire group.
""If the federal government does not know who the real Boko Haram is, I think they should come here to find out from us,"" Gubio said.
""The real Boko Haram who are killing us, who are burning our towns and villages, are not the Boko Haram that a peace deal was reached with.""
The government claimed a deal was reached after talks in Chad, which included provisions for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped from the Borno town of Chibok in April.

Sorkin explained he had high hopes for Bale: ""There isn't a scene or a frame that he's not in. So it's an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it.""

The Sony film has been in progress since 2012 and was due to start filming this winter, after former director David Fincher dropped out of the project in April over a pay dispute.

It ‘outs’ him as Paul Horner, a 34-year-old born in Liverpool and says he is being held “without” bail, along with four other, unnamed individuals.

Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks confirmed to the Independent the now viral story is a hoax.

1302,"While hype around the Apple Watch has remained steady, one factor has hurt consumers' interest: No one has known when it's arriving. All that Apple revealed was that the device — its first foray into wearables — would be unveiled sometime in early 2015. Does that mean right after New Year's? Or early Spring? Now, we're getting a clearer idea on the release date for the Apple Watch.

Sources familiar with the product’s development told 9to5Mac that the device is on track to ship by the end of March. Additionally, multiple sources revealed that Apple is planning a comprehensive testing program to train retail store employees on the new product between Feb. 9-16.

The program will entail sending one to two associates from each U.S. store to the company's offices in Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas. There, employees will be familiarized with all the features of the watch first-hand. Those employees will then train the staff at their respective stores.

While the plan is reportedly to release the wearable in March, 9to5Mac noted that unexpected delays are always a possibility. If there are any setbacks in terms of software development or manufacturing, the Apple Watch may not hit stores until April or later.

As I wrote in December:

Apple certainly made some smart decisions for the firm’s foray into wearables. For one, the company refused to describe the product as a “smartwatch” — something that separated their gadget from competitors’. On the other hand, the tech giant also opted not to hold any big press events about the watch after their initial announcement, and marketing efforts have been relatively weak in comparison to their other products.
While Apple analyst Gene Munster has pointed to waning interest in the Apple Watch, analysts such as Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research has still been arguing that the Apple Watch will be a smash success, Barron’s reported. (Chowdhry even argued that every iPhone user will also be an Apple Watch user, according to Barron's.)"

CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO DIED FOR 48 MINUTES CLAIMS THAT GOD IS A WOMAN

February 4th, 2015 | by Barbara Johnson

Boston| A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

Priest who died for 48 minutes says he met God and she’s a woman

We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.


Analysis: Pure fiction. There is no ""Father John Michael O'Neal"" in the Archdiocese of Boston. So says a spokesperson for the Archbishop himself, Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley.

""I believe this could be a hoax story,"" the spokesperson told a writer for the website Metro.co.uk, which had earlier repeated the false story above without verification. The initial report was also duplicated uncritically on dozens of other blogs and websites.

It wouldn't have been difficult to debunk the story when it first appeared, if anyone had cared to do so. It originated on the satirical website World News Daily Report, after all, which states on its disclaimer page:

All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.

Not only does it revolve around a priest who doesn't exist, the story further claims that Archbishop O'Malley, a real official of the Church, issued a public disavowal of the priest's alleged statements. There is no public record of such a disavowal.

Among the preposterous items that have appeared on World News Daily Report over the past year or so are ""news stories"" claiming that a 600-pound woman gave birth to a 40-pound baby, a Japanese whaling crew was eaten alive by killer whales, and a Chinese miner found alive after being trapped underground for 17 years."
1305,"Cuban dissidents and Cuban-American media are reporting that Havana is plagued with the most serious rumors in months that former dictator Fidel Castro has died, after the one-year anniversary of Castro’s last public appearance transpired without fanfare on Thursday.

The rumors began to circulate almost immediately after President Barack Obama announced that the United States would yield major concessions to the Cuban government in exchange for the freedom of USAID worker Alan Gross, jailed for attempts to bring Internet services to Jewish Cubans. As Fox News Latino reports, Fidel Castro made no public comments on the matter, triggering a wave of rumors in Cuban dissident media. Castro has previously commented on a number of current events, including blaming the United States and the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, of creating the Islamic State terrorist group in September.

One dissident blogger in particular, Yusnaby Pérez, exacerbated rumors by writing about them in a Spanish-language post titled “Has Fidel Died?“, in which he detailed changes in behavior from neighborhood communists who had previously been loud and fervent in their displays of support for the Castros, particularly on January 1, the anniversary of the Revolution:

This January 1st, my neighbor Mercy did not hang her “VIVA LA REVOLUCIÓN” sign, as usual, at the entrance to her house. How strange! It is the first year since I can remember that neither Fidel nor my neighbor’s odious sign–with Soviet font–appears.

Pérez tweeted that, almost immediately after publishing the blog post, the Cuban government shut down his entire page, at least within Cuba. His Twitter account appeared unscathed, however, where he posted images of Cubans wearing American flag leggings after the announcement of President Obama’s concessions to the Castros.

Rumors strengthened this week, however, as the anniversary of Castro’s last appearance approached. News outlets in Miami, the de facto capital of the Cuban diaspora, reported this week that the Cuban government had called for a press conference today to follow up Castro’s year-long absence with an update, many speculating that they would announce Castro’s death. The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied that any such press conference was scheduled for today, however, or that they had any major news to break. Instead, they noted that there was no record of an email or text message sent out to convene reporters, as is customary.

But dissidents continue to report strange incidents that give fuel to the rumor that, if not dead, Castro is close to death. Miami media professor Carlos Peñalosa reported that rumors had not been abated by the Cuban government message, and that “[Venezuelan President Nicolás] Maduro must be on his way to Havana”:


Yusnaby Pérez also reports that there are “strong” rumors that Raúl Castro called the socialist Venezuelan president urgently to Havana, another alleged sign that Castro has died:


Maduro had traveled to China to ask the Chinese government for financial aid, as the Venezuelan economy is collapsing under his socialist price controls and suffering due to the extremely low international prices of crude oil. And despite the rumors, Venezuelan state media reported that he landed in Iran today, with no apparent emergencies to attend to on the Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, Venezuelan opposition media are reporting that his departure from China was indicative enough of a route back to Cuba.

While there are no concrete answers to whether the Cuban government is hiding either the impending or already occurring death of the leader of the communist revolution, the Daily Mail has a theory: that Cuban dissident media has confused the former dictator with Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician who died this week."
1306,"Ahmed Abdi Godane was the 'principal target' of the Monday attack.

A U.S. airstrike killed the leader of a Somali terrorist group Monday, the Pentagon confirmed Friday.

Al Shabab head Ahmed Abdi Godane — who was considered one of the world's most wanted men — was the 'the principal target' of the attack, officials said Tuesday when they announced the strike.

The Pentagon knew immediately that six people were killed in the Monday strike, but Godane was not identified as a victim until Friday.

The other five victims have not been identified.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the reviled leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated group. The State Department desperately wanted to find him and had put a $7 million bounty on his head.

His death deals a major blow to the Somali terror network, the Pentagon said.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Defense Department’s chief spokesman, said the drone and aircraft attack directly targeted the terrorists.

Six people, including Godane, were killed. The other five victims have not been named.

In the strike, missiles destroyed a suspected terrorist compound near the port city of Barawe, a stronghold of the group. The missiles hit Godane as he left a meeting of the group's top leaders.

President Barack Obama said airstrike was highly calculated and well planned.

“That deliberation allows us to do it right,” he said at a Friday press conference.

The airstrike against Al Shabab is part of the U.S.’s larger anti-terrorism campaign. Troops have previously launched strikes against ISIS terrorists in Iraq.

“The goal has to be dismantle them,” Obama said of ISIS, Al Shabab and other terrorist organizations.

According to Corriere Adriatico, the nun had no idea that she was pregnant when she was rushed into hospital by fellow members of the cloistered all-female convent in the central city of Macerata.

When ultrasound showed that she was heavily pregnant, the woman - who is originally from South America - was immediately taken to delivery the baby, the website says.

Asked about the surprise news, the local Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino said it up to the unidentified sister if she wanted to stay within the Church.

He also dismissed calls for the nun to be excommunicated, saying: ""Excommunication is something really big and can not be issued for having a baby.""

Users claim the new Apple device catches strands of hair between the phone's screen and the metal frame, pulling beard hair and head hair out when they move the phone away from their head. People took to Twitter using the hashtags #hairgate and #beardgate to voice their grievances.

This newest ""gate"" follows complaints a few weeks ago that the phone bends under pressure, an issue that became known as #Bendgate.

""If you buy an iPhone 6, you better be totally bald #HairGate,"" @redletter tweeted.

iPhone 6 user @philquinn1 tweeted a photo of his phone with one strand of beard hair caught. ""#hairgate is real- sort of. This is from my beard on my iPhone 6. I will say that it took several swipes. #ouch,"" he wrote.

""#HairGate is very real. Have experienced it a few times myself with the iPhone 6. Didn't know that was a thing until today,"" @abcdedgar tweeted.

Some have made fun of the hair situation. Doctored images of people using phones to shave legs and beards made their way around the Web with the tag lines ""Our best phone and our best shave,"" and ""Stay smooth: iPhone 6.""

And Razor company Gillette saw an advertising opportunity and took it.

""Your phone may be smarter than ever, but leave the shaving to the experts. #beardgate,"" tweeted @Gillette.

Plenty of people expressed doubt about the whole thing, too.

""I have big curly hair that gets caught in EVERYTHING, and it has never been caught in my iPhone 6. I say #hairgate was started by Samsung,"" @JustAlly tweeted.

""I can report the gap between the front glass and aluminium does not exist,"" Forbes' Gordon Kelly wrote in an article dismissing the most recent iPhone ""gate.""

""There is a bevel, but the glass front panel is actually fused to the aluminum and the tiny gap you do see is significantly narrower than a human hair,"" he wrote.

Mashable created a video that disputes the complaints. It shows people rubbing the phone on their hair and faces. ""We've gone with beards and curly hair and long hair, short hair, your hair, my hair,"" reporter Christina Warren said in the video.

""Hairgate is not a thing,"" she said.

In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers.

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger . Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

“We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,” Mr Dean said.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.”

But the hardy burger is not the only long-lived Maccy D’s in existence.

The last McDonald's cheeseburger ever sold in Iceland is still going strong and mould-free – six years after it was bought by a burger-lover.

The fast-food giant shut up shop in Iceland in 2009 because it said the country's financial crisis had made it too expensive to operate.

1312,"Nouakchott — The Tripoli airport siege led to the disappearance of several commercial planes. Now countries on both shores of the Mediterranean are worried about how the missing aircraft might be used by terrorists.

Rival militias have fought for control of the airport since mid-July, inflicting civilian casualties and extensive damage. But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge.

After eleven civilian airliners were hijacked during the fighting, ""5+5"" member states reportedly decided to add an element to their scheduled joint military exercise. This time, simulations will include intercepting civilian or military aircraft piloted by terrorists.

The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday, (August 18th).

""Libya was finally excluded because of the deteriorating security situation"", Reporters.DZ quoted the Turkish agency as saying.

The objective of the exercise is to counter potential threats, such as the kind of suicide attacks seen on September 11, 2001, Sahara Media reported Monday.

Libya in recent months has become a hotbed for the most dangerous terrorists in the Sahel region. These include veteran jihadists who migrated to Libya after fighting in Syria.

""These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens,"" analyst Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries, he added.

According to Moroccan reporter Youssef Lakhdar, ""Co-ordination must be at all levels and not only when an imminent danger is coming.""

If Maghreb countries had coalesced sooner, the security chaos in Libya might have been averted, he said.

""Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries but for all countries of the world,"" Lakhdar added.

The issue of Maghreb security came up August 15th, when African leaders attended the 70th anniversary commemoration of the Allied invasion of southern France during World War II.

Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was among the African leaders and WWII veterans invited to watch naval parades and air shows near Toulon.

His participation comes within the framework of strengthening security, military and economic co-operation between Mauritania and France, noted journalist Mohammed Yacoub Ould Moustafa.

""Many sons of the colonies participated in World War II,"" he added.

""This is why the presence of the Mauritanian president for this celebration is in recognition of Mauritania's efforts, in addition to the security policies connecting France with the countries of the Sahel,"" he said."

The ironic part is that the unfounded rumors actually triggered a real police investigation. After receiving inquiries from the Detroit media, the Detroit police department contacted producers of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice to inquire if the Batmobile had indeed been stolen.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody issued the statement, “The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs.”

And for those that might claim any type of police cover-up in regards to the theft of the Batmobile, the Detroit Free Press also confirmed with sources close to the production that the Ben Affleck’s ride had not been stolen.

1314,"British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the man suspected of the horrific beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to UK media reports.

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

In early August he tweeted a photo of himself wearing military camouflage and a black hood, while holding a severed head in his left hand.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killers, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a ""significant force"" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting IS. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadis.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the man hunt. He is one of the British jihadists former hostages referred to as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called ""George"" and ""Ringo"".

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trail on terrorism in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of the UK's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria."
1315,"The identity of the couple behind the mega-successful DC Toys Collector Youtube channel has finally been uncovered. Reportedly the highest paid creators on Youtube, having raked in an estimated $5 million in 2014, DC Toys Collector is allegedly 29-year-old, Brazilian-born Daiane DeJesus, a former adult film actress known as Sandy Summers, and her husband, Messias Credido, according to the Daily Mail. DeJesus’s porn star past could explain why the mega-successful Youtuber has chosen to stay anonymous despite months-long digging from numerous media outlets covering her channel’s surprising popularity. With over 5.2 billion views to date and nearly 3.8 million subscribers, the channel is an unbridled Youtube success — the scrutiny attracted by revelations of her adult film star past may have been figured by a cautious DeJesus to potentially dampen her kid-friendly channel’s image, and ultimately, perhaps, its huge revenue stream. Former neighbors and a “close friend” are behind the revelation that the DeJesus and Credido are behind the DC Toys Collector channel. The neighbors say they only learned of DeJesus’s adult film star career, which she reportedly quit seven years ago, after they saw her participating in a photoshoot by her swimming pool. They then say they were able to confirm their suspicions after identifying her in several “graphic adult-only videos.” The videos uploaded to the DC Toys Collector channel all feature a pair of disembodied, feminine hands unpackaging new toys as a soft voice narrates. They are a part of the “unboxing” video trend, which, according to Google, saw a 57% increase in views from 2013 to 2014. “That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere,” said one of the neighbors after listening to a DC Toys Collector video. The neighbor added: “Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. “We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. “Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers’ website and it all clicked into place.” When asked if the couple were behind the DC Toys Collector channel, formerly the Disney Collector channel, the ex-wife of Credido, Maribel Barreto, said: “Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can’t say any more.” Credido has also been identified as the creator behind the successful BluCollector Youtube channel, whose videos are nearly identical to the DC Toys Collector channel’s videos, except that they focus on toys aimed at young boys.

1317,"Breitbart Texas has confirmed the existence of an Islamic tribunal in Texas that will make judgments in accordance with Sharia law.

The website for the Islamic tribunal states: “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”

The website states that Sharia’s well known criminal law, which includes things like cutting off hands of offenders, is only a portion of Sharia law. This tribunal would not do such things, but will focus on civil Sharia law rather than criminal Sharia law.

Breitbart Texas interviewed one of the tribunal’s “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. El-badawi said that the tribunal is done in accordance with Sharia as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” He also added that the tribunal is not arbitration. The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” instead of “arbitrators.” He said that the tribunal will resolve civil business and family disputes, as well as workplace disputes.

El-badawi was asked what would happen if there is conflict between the laws of Texas and Sharia law. He responded that the laws are in agreement most of the time, but said that Sharia would take precedence out of the two in the tribunal.

There are four judges listed on the tribunal’s website: Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh, and Dr. El-badawi."
1318,"(Reuters) - Even in India, where government jobs are considered to be for life, A.K. Verma was pushing it.

Verma, an executive engineer at the Central Public Works Department, was fired after last appearing for work in December 1990.

""He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,"" the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of ""wilful absence from duty"" in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

India's labour laws, which the World Bank says are the most restrictive anywhere, make it hard to sack staff for any reason other than criminal misconduct.

States, led by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have recently changed the law to make it easier to hire and fire staff, in a move welcomed by industry leaders but opposed by labour unions.

A TV weatherman was caught with his trousers down - literally - when a news report cut to him ""using the bathroom.""

NBC Nightly anchorman Lester Holt in the New York studio cut to an outdoor weather forecast but his man in the field was busy having a crafty wee in the bushes.

Weatherman Mike Seidel obviously thought he had enough time to have a quick tinkle before presenting his segment, but when a cameraman shouted for him to look lively he just turned round, muttering ""why?""

Seidel is seen doing up his flies and putting his gloves back on (we're sure he usually washes his hands) as the all professional news reader diplomatically tells viewers that the weatherman isn't quite ready yet.

The image - which is thought to have been taken in Seattle - prompted a mixed response from online users after it was posted on Reddit this week, with some appearing to revel in the crude drawing.

One person said; ""The spray paint is almost an improvement"", while another wrote; ""If you can afford a Bugatti, you can afford to park it in a secure lot.""

But others condemned the graffiti artist for vandalism.

A Reddit user said: ""This hurts me to look at. You never f*** with someone's vehicle.""

The identity of the car owner remains unknown and it was not immediately clear if anyone had been arrested for vandalism of the vehicle."
1321,"Hear about the Australian man who had a spider crawl into his body through his appendix scar and all the way up to his sternum? As much as our collective morbid curiosity kind of wants it to be true, scientists have come to lend some healthy perspective to the situation.

Did it really happen?
Image: schankz/Shutterstock
Yesterday it was reported in The Age that an Australian man had experienced something rather strange and all kinds of horrifying during a trip to Bali. After feeling a “searing sensation” around his abdomen near his old appendix scar, Dylan Thomas from Bunbury in Western Australia says he found out that a spider had crawled into his body through his scar and had made its way right up to his sternum.
""It wasn't really a tickling sensation, obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling,"" he told Radio 6PR.
After a day or two of taking antihistamines, Thomas was feeling worse, and took himself to the hospital. He says the doctors finally found the cause of his discomfort. ""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last three days, managed to get it out luckily,"" he told his friends on Facebook, according to Aleisha Orr at The Age.
It sounds pretty far-fetched, and Thomas could well be telling the truth as it was relayed to him at the hospital, but Lauren Davis from io9 spoke to some scientists to get some much-needed perspective.
""I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,” arachnid expert Christopher Buddle from McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences told Davis. ""Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.""
The best explanation the scientists Davis spoke to could come up with was that the doctors in Bali pulled something out of Thomas’s body, but it was far more likely to be a tick or a mite. Just not a spider. 
""I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders),” Marie Herberstein, who is the Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in Australia, told Davis. But she was careful to not completely rule out the possibility. She mentions that mites are also eight-legged, so perhaps it was just a really bit mite?  
Head to io9 to read the rest of Lauren Davis's research into this odd story. Other than that, all we can do now is wait for the specimen - which is reportedly sitting in a jar somewhere - to surface..."
1323,"(Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will release a new ad-supported video streaming service early next year, the New York Post reported, citing sources.

The service will be separate from the company's $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, the Post reported. (bit.ly/1BU9mCU)

The Post did not say if the new service would be free or chargeable. Amazon's Prime service costs $99 a year.

Amazon was not immediately available for comment.

The new service will compete directly with Hulu and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), whose charges start at $7.99 a month for customers in the United States.

Though the new service will be separate from Prime, ultimately Amazon plans to lure more users and eventually get them to sign up for Prime, the Post said.

1327,"Whenever I was sick (or fake-sick) in middle school and stayed home, I would watch a lot of The Price Is Right, SportsCenter, and whichever Star Wars movie was rewound to the beginning of the film on VHS. Occasionally, however, I’d flip over to PBS and see how long I could stomach the adventures of Dipsy, Laa-Laa, Po, and the Gay One. This was during peak Teletubbies craze, when it was unavoidably popular (and weirdly controversial), and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. But as soon as the sun baby started giggling, I said NOPE to that and went back to yelling at idiots for overbidding on a washing machine that clearly cost less than $3,500.

At least now I know who to direct my sun rage at: 19-year-old Jess Smith, a first-year college student at Canterbury Christ Church University who claims she played the monster in the sky (not God). She filmed the part when she was nine months old and didn’t tell anyone outside of her family until “a game with her university friends – where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.” Finally, a freshman orientation that isn’t pointless.

Miss Smith said: “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.”

She then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it. I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.” (Via)

“Dude, I totally hooked up with the baby from Teletubbies” is the new “I got to sixth base with Haley Joel Osment.” To prove her claim, Smith reportedly posted this letter on her Facebook.

During filming, Smith was seated in a high chair, “so she would be looking down like the sun,” and her dad made her laugh by playing with a stuffed bear behind the camera.

Witnesses describe Bibeau as wearing a black coat with blue jeans throughout the shootings, while his weapon of choice was a double-barrel shotgun.

Early reports indicate Bibeau was shot dead by Canadian Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. An ISIS social media account tweeted a photograph claiming Bibeau as one of their own, but neither the image nor the connection have been verified.

1330,"A Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State militants earlier this month has been kidnapped by the group, Israeli media reported Sunday morning.

Gill Rosenberg's kidnapping was reported by The Jerusalem Post as well as ynetnews.com, the English-language edition of Ynet, Israel's largest and most popular news website.

""The reports began surfacing on jihadi and Palestinian social media and forums, and claim Rosenberg was taken while fighting with the Peshmerga forces in Kobani, Syria,"" ynetnews.com said on its site.

The Post said that in an interview with Israel Radio in early November, Rosenberg said she had decided to join the fighters for humanitarian and ideological reasons and “because they are our brothers” who are fighting Islamic State.

Friends of Rosenberg posted messsages on her Facebook page shortly after the news of her possible kidnapping broke.

""Hope this is wrong and you come back safely. Gila bat Avraham,"" Ed-Malki Dvir wrote.

And Chris Levy posted: ""I hope this isn't true but if it is then I am praying for you and your other captured hevals in your darkest hours."" Heval means friend in Kurdish.

Haaretz.com, the online edition of Israel's oldest daily newspaper, said ""the pro-Islamic State blog Samoach al-Islam reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Gill Rosenberg.

""According to the report, prior to their capture, Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.""

Haaretz says, Samoach al-Islam is considered to be one of the media arms of ISIS.

1331,"Ottawa shooting video shown by police

The RCMP released security footage that showed Michael Zehaf Bibeau running towards Parliament with his gun drawn, carjacking a minister’s car and attempting to make his final assault on Centre Block.

In a lengthy press conference Thursday afternoon, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson also said Michael Zehaf Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo from behind, and the soldier did not see him coming. Zehaf Bibeau shot at a second soldier with Cpl. Cirillo, but missed.

Police say the video shows Zehaf Bibeau was able to get from Wellington Street to Centre Block in about one minute and 20 seconds and there was little time to respond. The video shows Mounties chasing him, closely behind.

The video does not show what occurred inside Parliament, where Zehaf Bibeau was killed. Police said they are still putting together what happened inside.



Paulson said Zehaf Bibeau was in Ottawa to apply for a passport, which was in the process of being evaluated, and they believe he wanted to travel to Syria. Paulson said there is no known link between Zehaf Bibeau and Martin Couture-Rouleau, who ran down two Canadian soldiers in Quebec Monday, killing one.

However, Zehaf Bibeau was associated with “an individual known to us,” Paulson said. He said the gunman’s email was found in the hard drive of a person charged with a terror-related offence.

The RCMP commissioner also said the gunman was not one of the 93 people on the RCMP’s high-risk travel list.

Screen Shot 2014-10-23 at 4.11.02 PM

Zehaf Bibeau’s mother told the RCMP that her son wanted to travel to Syria when they spoke to her Wednesday, Paulson said.

Police say do not know how he got the weapon, a 30-30 Winchester lever action rifle, and that’s a significant part of their investigation. He was banned from owning a firearm, the RCMP said.

Zehaf Bibeau came to Ottawa on October 2 and was staying at the Ottawa Mission, a downtown men’s shelter. Residents there said he struggled with drug addiction and he was “furious” about not being able to get a passport.

“He went on for more than an hour about how much this country sucked and how he wanted to get out of here, and he was furious about the passport,” Mission resident Norman LeBlanc told The Canadian Press Thursday.

This is the shocking moment a woman accused of sleeping with someone else's husband was savagely beaten in broad daylight as passers-by watched on.

It's the latest in a string of copycat attacks in China, including one a month ago when a half-naked woman was stamped on by a stiletto-wearing rival.

Locals say such scraps go ignored because there is an acceptance that love cheats are deserving of a beating having caused a man to cheat on his partner.

In this latest incident, accused Lin Yao Li, 38, was ambushed by four women as she walked home from shops in Puyang, in eastern China's Henan Province.

CEN   Savage: Lin Yao Li was accused of sleeping with another woman's husband

Punching and kicking her to the ground while she writhed in agony, her attackers then ripped her clothes off and continued the beating, pulling her hair and kicking her in the breasts and groin.

Local reports say the sickening attack was carried out by the scorned wife of the man Lin is accused of sleeping with and her three friends.

Meanwhile, as the stomach-turning drama unfolded, scores of people pass by without making an attempt to help the outnumbered and defenceless victim.

Local man Jun Feng, 30, who helped the woman after spotting her lying on the ground told local TV: ""This type of thing is becoming quite normal.

""Angry wives and girlfriends get their revenge on their cheating men by attacking the other woman.

""People don't tend to get involved because they see it as being an argument of the heart.""

1335,"Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.

Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”

Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment."
1336,"Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by ISIS militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday.

Separately, Foley’s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a webpage that was created to rally support for his release.

In the statement, Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, said the journalist, quote, “gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”

One of the U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday.

The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name.

Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it’s likely that some were.

The Internet video begins with scenes of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq. Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, a black-clad Islamic State fighter by his side. Foley’s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report last November, CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group’s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives’ release.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida’s leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have killed soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions – including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004."

ihadi militants in Syria say that US-led coalition air strikes have killed Kayla Jean Mueller, an American aid worker, who was being held hostage by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (known as Isis).
Social media sites used by the group said Ms Mueller, 26, was killed in coalition air strikes on the Isis stronghold at Raqqa, a city in northern Syria. Pictures posted online, however, offered no conclusive evidence of her death.
Isis supporters posted photographs from the group’s media wing showing a flattened building. “Rubble from the building which the American hostage Kayla Jean Mueller is buried beneath,” said the label of one picture.

Officials in Washington said they could not confirm the claim. “We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil’s claim,” said Marie Harf, a state department spoksewoman.
Ms Mueller was captured by Isis more than a year ago along with a group of aid workers, all of whom have been released, probably by ransom. Isis was demanding millions of dollars for her release, but the US has a strict policy of rejecting ransom demands.
If Ms Mueller’s death is confirmed, she would be the eighth foreign hostage killed in Isis captivity, and the fourth American.
A statement attributed to Isis and posted online said the house where Ms Mueller was being held was on a site hit by strikes lasting more than an hour on Friday. Its authenticity could not be immediately verified.
“God thwarted their intentions and responded to their cunning. Not a single mujahid [holy warrior] was hit,” the statement said. “We have confirmation that the American prisoner was killed by its fire.”
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said that dozens of fighters were killed in the strikes, which focused on suspected Isis bases west of Raqqa.
Activists inside Raqqa said the area was pummeled by air strikes in what was widely perceived by locals as revenge strikes for the execution by Isis of Muath al-Kassaesbeh, a captured Jordanian coalition pilot. He was burned alive in a video that shocked his countrymen and triggered vows of an “earthquake of revenge” by Amman’s forces.
Jordan is one of the Arab countries participating in the US-led coalition against Isis. The coalition has been launching near daily air strikes against Isis territory, which spans about a quarter of both Syria and Iraq.
Isis supporters on Twitter, who posted the images of the destroyed building that allegedly housed Ms Mueller, taunted Jordan for the young captive’s alleged killing. “Bring on your revenge,” said one Isis follower."

""It was a fight that lasted 40 minutes,"" says Dino. Before now no one had ever managed to capture a prey so great with the technique of spinning, a type of fishing with artificial bait. When they felt the appropriate time, have pulled it towards the boat and then, with great difficulty by the torpedo, they hooked and towed to shore. Although destroyed by fatigue are happy for the company: the brothers win it a mention in the Guinness Book of Records. ""To fish these giants of the river, you must have patience but also a lot of physical strength,"" says the fisherman. In truth, the two are quite well-known in the catfish fishing for making other exceptional catches in the past: ""In 20 years we have caught about 1,800.""

It is thought that the torpedo can achieve even four feet long, although so far there is no evidence. And the prey, what happened? The giant is still in the Po. After a few shots have thrown back into the water. ""Who am I to take his life?"" Says Dino Ferrari. Maybe in a year will be able to catch them again.

1339,"Tiger Woods' agent responded Monday to inflammatory allegations made by little-known pro Dan Olsen, who said on the Mad Dog in the Morning radio show last week that Woods is serving a suspension for a failed drug test.

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"" agent Mark Steinberg said. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""

On Monday morning, the PGA Tour responded to the claims.

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.

Woods is on leave from the PGA Tour as he tries to sort out issues with his game, especially with his chipping. Woods, who said he would not return to the Tour until he can compete with the best in the game, missed the cut in the Waste Management Phoenix Open in his first tournament of the season – shooting a career-high 82 in the process – and then withdrew with a stiff back after 11 holes the following week in the Farmers Insurance Open.

Woods said his back problems are not the reason for his hiatus from the game, nor are they related to the injuries that forced him to have back surgery last March 31.

""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this,"" Olsen said Friday on the radio show. ""Well, it's not testosterone, but it's something else.""

Olsen also said Woods was using untested equipment."
1340,"Boko Haram thinks all the truce talk is hilarious. At least that is what it seems like judging from a video released Friday to Nigerian media that purported to show the terrorist group’s leader Abubakar Shekau laughing off claims that it had reached a ceasefire with the government and that the more than 200 girls the group kidnapped six months ago were close to being released. “A lie,” Shekau said. ""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling, according to CNN. He then added that the girls converted to Islam and “have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.” In fact, the whole issue about the kidnapped girls has been “long forgotten,” he added.

In the video, Shekau said he had no idea whom the supposed negotiator was who supposedly worked out a cease-fire deal with the government on behalf of the Islamist group. ""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator. He also threatened to kill a captured German hostage, who is “always crying.” He added that the extremist group could “hack him or slaughter him or shoot him,” reports the Associated Press.

Throughout the rambling speech, Shekau, who “bristled with theatrical rage,” talked about everything from the “Islamic State to obscure Nigerian politicians to a threat to ‘eat the heart of infidels,’ ” reports the Wall Street Journal. Yet more than what he said, the mere release of a video is bad news for President Goodluck Jonathan, whose administration had touted the cease-fire on the campaign trail. Jonathan is expected to win a second term in February."

BEIRUT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,"" Abdulrahman said.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING ""CLOSE EYE""

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

""We don't have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don't have any information on that either,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

1342,"Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has just made a shocking admission.

In a post on her Facebook, Chandler is revealing she was actually born a boy, and named David Roy Fitch at birth.

As a teenager however Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia.

Shocker: Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler (above) has admitted she was born David Roy Fitch, and had both male and female genitalia

In the dark: Chandler said her new man Phelps (above) was not aware of her past, though there's no actual proof that the two were ever an official item

Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia

Feet in the sand: Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights

Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries.

As she explains in a Facebook post, 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.'

She then adds, 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.'

She is also revealing how in love she is with Phelps, and claims the two clicked after meeting on Tinder.

'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says.

'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.'

I'm yelling Tinder: A look at Phelps' alleged Tinder profile, which is how he and Chandler first met

She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer.

'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview.

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.'

She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up.

Famous friends: Chandler cozies up to RuPaul's Drag Race alum Detox

So sweet: Chandler posted this image of Phelps to her account and wrote about how excited she was to see him again

Now however, Chandler thinks Phelps may 'leave her' after telling her truth.

'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says.

Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer, with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner.

She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship.

He's out: Chandler said on her Facebook on Wednesday that Phelps is out of rehab

Still on?: Phelps has yet to comment on any of this

Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.

The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler.

The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them, and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41-years-old.

Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI.

Boots for days: Chandler's Facebook page is a shrine to Phelps, with the swimmer's photos everywhere

In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life.

'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains.

'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.'

'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.'

'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.'

She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights."
1343,"Rumors of Ebola turned out to be far more contagious than the virus itself this weekend as online media whipped up a feverish story, later disproven, of a suspected Ebola case in Kansas City.

After appearing on a local blog and a Wichita television website Saturday night, the rumor went viral, spreading to such national outlets as Breitbart.com.

Then on Sunday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Research Medical Center issued a statement:

“We have seen online reports that a patient at Research Medical Center is suspected of having Ebola. These reports are inaccurate. Research Medical Center is caring for a patient who presented to our Brookside Campus emergency department, however, the patient does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.”

That was followed Monday by a statement from the Kansas City Health Department: “The Health Department has ruled out the presence of Ebola in Kansas City.”

“There was a social media frenzy about the possibility of Ebola in Kansas City,” said Jeff Hershberger, a department spokesman. “We’re still exploring how this happened.”

Hospitals and the general public have been on edge since an Ebola case was diagnosed last week at a hospital in Dallas. Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital’s failure to recognize that Duncan may have had Ebola during an earlier visit to its emergency room has heightened vigilance further.

Details about what happened Saturday in Kansas City are still unclear, but a feverish man was taken to Research Medical Center’s Brookside Campus on Saturday night. The man apparently was from Nigeria, a country that has had Ebola cases but is not among the three African countries engulfed in the current epidemic.

The patient’s travel history and fever “triggered them to look at things that included Ebola,” Hershberger said.

Kansas City police said they received a call Saturday night from a nurse who told them the hospital was under lockdown because of suspicions about the patient. The police decided to block access to the patient’s apartment in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard and to keep the vehicle used to take him to the hospital under observation.

“Neighbors saw (the police activity) and got worried and contacted the media,” Hershberger said.

Meantime, the blog TonysKansasCity.com posted the line: “First suspected report of Ebola in Kansas City!!” Tony Botello, who writes the blog, later revised that report.

KCTV-5 broadcast a story Saturday night about the apartment building being locked down because of a potentially contagious disease but never mentioned Ebola, said Darrin McDonald, the station’s vice president and general manager.

If a Wichita station reported it was a case of the Ebola virus, “they connected dots that we never did,” McDonald said.

Gordon Beedle, a news producer at KWCH-12 in Wichita, said the station received information from KCTV about the story and posted its own version online. Beedle said he couldn’t recall exactly what that story said and couldn’t trace it Monday night.

Sunday night, KCTV reported that Kansas City health officials said it was not Ebola.

But on Saturday night, others told a different story, said Christine Hamele, a spokeswoman for HCA Midwest Health, which operates Research Medical Center.

“I was made aware of erroneous reports of a suspected Ebola case in the Kansas City area,” she said. “What was clear to me by 11 p.m. (Saturday) was that none of the information … was accurate.”

Hamele said the patient was transferred from Research’s Brookside Campus to the main hospital, where he was placed in isolation. He responded well to treatment and was released Monday, she said.

“A lot of us are on an extra alert because of what happened in Dallas,” Hershberger said. “What happened this weekend was a situation we would prefer to what happened in Dallas. We prefer extra vigilance to not enough vigilance.”

1344,"According to a new report from 9to5Mac, a new MacBook Air is coming. The new computer is alleged to have a12-inch screen, but remain about the size of the 11-inch model via reduced bezels on all sides. Possibly even cooler than that is the computer is said to be an actual thing, not like the iPad Pro we keep hearing about. Sources inside Apple claim to have been hands-on with the new device, which is also lighter than existing MacBook Airs.

Aside from sporting a larger screen and lighter design, there are several other interesting nuances, here. The new-look MacBook is sporting a single USB Type-C port, which sounds silly — but isn’t.

The USB Type-C port can handle things you’ve been relying on other ports to do for years, like external monitors. the new USB standard is also capable of charging, so MagSafes might be dead.

That also means no multiple USB ports, SD Card slot, Thunderbolt — and you won’t be able to natively charge and use an external monitor. The natural assumption here is that Apple will release some sort of hub alongside the new MacBook Air for those occasions when multitasking is necessary.

profilel-r-copy

The trackpad is said to be a touch bigger than the existing MacBook Air models (and get rid of the click), but the keyboard has reportedly been minimized to accommodate the slimmer profile. That means smaller keys, closer together, even though the keyboard is said to go edge-to-edge.

The report details the device as overall slimmer than the existing MacBook Air 11-inch (which sounds insane), but a touch taller to accommodate the larger 12-inch screen. Speaker grilles toward the top of the keyboard double as vents for the CPU, too.

What news don’t we get, here? Retina. Sadly, nothing in the report suggest we’ll get a Retina MacBook Air with the refresh. Fans of the dense Apple screens won’t find favor there, but we’ll all still marvel at the thin profile, should this actually come to pass as reported.

1346,"THE ISLAMIC State murderer dubbed 'Jihadi John' has been named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London, according to reports.

It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich.

He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.

The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

He is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012, before joining IS (also known as Isis or Isil), according to the Post.

According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a ""person of interest"" to British security services from at least 2011.

He apparently featured in ""semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK"".

He is thought to have been responsible for the brutal executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips.

The masked executioner appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity.

The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.

He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'.

Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said:

""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""(The) Prime Minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL (Islamic State) to face justice for the appalling acts carried out.

""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria.

""It is not appropriate for the Government to comment on any part of it while this continues.”"
1347,"The Apple Watch might be water resistant, according to comments reported by French site iGen (via AppleInsider). Either that or it's a misunderstanding, and we don't really know which. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees at an Apple Store in Berlin that he wears his Apple Watch everywhere, ""even in the shower.""

Apple has not officially designated the Apple Watch as either water proof or water resistant. If Mr. Cook actually said he wears his in the shower, it could indicate that Apple will market the device as one or the other.

The problem is the report is hearsay, and there could be some translation issues. It might even have been a joke. We have no context with which to judge this story. So don't invest too much in this rumor just yet.

In fact, I personally doubt the device is water resistant or proof. Even if the device is sealed, water and touch screens don't typically work well together at all. That would make it a coup for Apple—and if anyone could do it it is Apple—but I'm not expecting a water resistant or proof Apple Watch based on this anecdote.

Then there are the straps. Apple has plastic straps. but I wouldn't want to run the metal ones or leather through a shower.

Bah. I don't like this one at all.

In the meanwhile, Mr. Cook also reportedly says he charges his Apple Watch every night. This is in keeping with the very rough comments from Apple at the device's unveiling in September. At that time, we were told Apple had designed the watch to be charged at night, though the company was unspecific about how long it would actually run.

So yeah, I can believe that hasn't changed, but we still don't have context for the comments."
1349,"A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.

On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

“I never lied to him,” Chandler sayd. “We were together for such a short period of time, I never had a chance to tell him about my life.”"
1351,"There may be yet another bug in iOS 8, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.

MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that ""no data or media will be deleted,"" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.

The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.

iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to ""safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud."" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.

Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.
One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:

"" Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.""

The launch of iOS 8 has been a PR nightmare for Apple. One update managed to stop iPhone 6 users from making calls, and Apple was forced to pull the update and quickly work on a fix."
1352,"J.J. Abrams' heavily anticipated ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is currently slated to open in theaters this Dec. 18, 2015. But if there's truth to these recent release date rumors, the sequel could be hitting the cinemas on an earlier schedule.

An article from The Telegraph cited two separate ""unconfirmed reports"" from Ikwiz and Movie Pilot indicating that instead of winter, Star Wars VII might arrive in theaters ""this summer.""

""J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching,"" Movie Pilot wrote.

Ikwiz meanwhile stated that ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams' request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

This conclusion was apparently drawn from the statement which the ""Star Trek"" helmer gave off during the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) event on Feb. 4 where Abrams received the VES Visionary Award.

John Boyega, who is set to appear in the ""Star Wars"" sequel, recently shared his appreciation for the brilliance Abrams has put in the gigantic film project.

""It was brilliant,"" Boyega told BBC. ""J.J. Abrams is obviously a passionate guy and does well in this movie and I can't wait for it come out.""

As for the movie itself, the 22-year-old quipped that fans should really brace themselves when it arrives.

""I think they should be very excited,"" he added. ""We're going back to the originals, we're staying true to practical effects and we have the original cast back, and it's going to be a great time."""

Describing reports of suspect cases of the deadly viral infection in Mosul as ""rumor"", the Geneva-based United Nations health agency said it and the Iraqi health ministry had conducted a full investigation.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola,"" the WHO said in a statement.

""The (Iraqi) Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola virus.""

Reports of suspected Ebola cases appeared on Dec. 31 in Iraq's Al-Sabah newspaper, Rudaw online newspaper and on the Shafaq news agency and were relayed through other media in and outside Iraq, prompting the WHO and Iraqi authorities to investigate.

Terrifying Incident: Armed officers were called out following a shooting in Ottawa today

Video filmed from inside the parliament building shows officers rushing down a large marble hallway with handguns held in front of them, before the sound of gunfire and shouting rings out.

In footage from the Globe and Mail, armed police can be seen running down a corridor as they search for the suspect gunman before a volley of shots are heard.

The footage becomes shaky as the cameraman, believed to be a local reporter, rushes for cover behind a pillar.

1357,"There's an illustration being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today.

While the image does have a touching message, it's almost certainly a fake - not created by Banksy.

Here's the illustration that everyone is sharing:

Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a ""popular 'Banksy' account"" on Instagram. The instagram.com/banksy Instagram isn't run by Banksy at all, and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists - rarely with any attribution.

Search on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you'll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages. The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts. He does, however, have one Instagram account, which was used during his recent trip to New York.

Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it.

The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles. As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts, the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity.

Here's an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.

It's tricky to verify new Banksy work. Because of Banksy's continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy. A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are, however, experts in his work, meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy.

Nevertheless, given today's tragic events, the sentiment is strong.

1358,"It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone.

A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated.""

Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation.

""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this.""

1360,"KFC (NYSE:YUM) Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.

In the state of Colorado, cannabis clinics are big industry – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers made an impact on the KFC Corporation, they made the decision to include a pot dispensary to be a part of their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the chance to build a foundation into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.

The KFC Corporation was able to get approval on February 3, 2015 for their Cannabis Retail Recreational Marijuana / Medical Cannabis Occupational Business License.

So far, 42 of the almost 100 KFC franchises that are located in the state Colorado have made this “option”  an addition to their menu.

 Their is actually a humorous comparison due to the south park episode “medicinal fried chicken” having to do with KFC selling marijuana with there famous fried chicken

In the midst of all this a major crisis happens for cartman when his favorite foods at KFC are all replaced with medicinal marijuana stores. Though KFC isn’t going out of business they are adapting to a new trend.

“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success,” says KFC spokesperson William Rausch. “It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado.”

For the people choosing to buy marijuana they must provide a picture ID showing that they are 21 years or older in order to make a purchase

Coloradans are only allowed to purchase 28 grams at one time, while people who are not citizens of colorado are limited on their purchase only be allowed to buy a quarter at a time

Due to banking restrictions, when making a purchase in dispensaries it is a cash only business . Ounces usually start at a price of 200 and only go up along with a pot tax of 25 %

In addition to making a profit from the “leafy green” they also have some delectable edibles in stock. They are offering Smashed Potatoes, Macaroni Munchies andBong Time Biscuits – all made with their tasty cannabis butter

KFC is anticipating to get all 100 franchisees ready to go with the new inventory by March 2016. #KushForCure"
1361,"In a new video, ISIS shows American-made weapons it says were intended for the Kurds but actually were air dropped into territory they control.

At least one bundle of U.S. weapons airdropped in Syria appears to have fallen into the hands of ISIS, a dangerous misfire in the American mission to speed aid to Kurdish forces making their stand in Kobani.

An ISIS-associated YouTube account posted a new video online Tuesday entitled, “Weapons and munitions dropped by American planes and landed in the areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.” The video was also posted on the Twitter account of “a3maq news,” which acts as an unofficial media arm of ISIS. The outfit has previously posted videos of ISIS fighters firing American made Howitzer cannons and seizing marijuana fields in Syria.

ISIS had broadly advertised its acquisition of a broad range of U.S.-made weapons during its rampage across Iraq. ISIS videos have showed its fighters driving U.S. tanks, MRAPs, Humvees. There are unconfirmed reports ISIS has stolen three fighter planes from Iraqi bases it conquered.

The authenticity of this latest video could not be independently confirmed, but the ISIS fighters in the video are in possession of a rich bounty of American hand grenades, rounds for small rockets, and other supplies that they will surely turn around and use on the Kurdish forces they are fighting in and around the Turkish border city.

On Monday, White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said the U.S. government was confident that the emergency airdropped supplies for the Kurdish forces near Kobani were falling into the right hands.

“We feel very confident that, when we air drop support as we did into Kobani… we’ve been able to hit the target in terms of reaching the people we want to reach,” Rhodes told CNN. “What I can assure people is that, when we are delivering aid now, we focus it on the people we want to receive that assistance. Those are civilians in need. Those are forces that we’re aligned with in the fight against ISIL [the government’s preferred acronym for ISIS], and we take precautions to make sure that it’s not falling into the wrong hands.”

Rhodes was responding to questions about a Monday report in The Daily Beast that U.S. humanitarian aid was flowing into ISIS controlled areas near Kobani by truck. That aid was mostly food and medical supplies, not the kind of lethal weapons in the new ISIS video.

Senior administration officials said Sunday that three American planes dropped a total of 27 bundles near Kobani and more U.S. air drops could come as part of the joint U.S.-Iraqi effort to aid Kurdish fighters in the Kobani area. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities, the official said.

In the new footage, the weapons appear to be U.S. made. There have also been at least 135 air strikes against ISIS in the area, according to the State Department.

The airstrikes and air drops appear to be having an impact. The Daily Beast’s Jamie Dettmer, reporting from the Syrian border, said the morale in Kobani has shifted in the last 24 hours. But ISIS continues to hold major swaths of territory in and around Kobani, despite widespread media reports to the contrary. And the civilians there are suffering, badly.

“I think what this represents is the President recognizes this is going to be a long-term campaign against ISIL; and that we need to look for whatever opportunity we can find to degrade that enemy and to support those who are fighting against ISIL on the ground,” a senior administration official told reporters."

Retina MacBook Air release date rumours: When is the new MacBook Air coming out?
The latest 'word on the street' (not our words) sounds to us like a bit of a long shot, but here goes. It's been suggested by a number of websites that Apple will launch its next range of MacBooks during the Christmas holidays.

Aside from the obvious problem (which is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the media), this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by Boy Genius Report, written back in August, being rehashed and misinterpreted this month.

For a start, BGR wrote that the next MacBook Air would be ready in time for the Christmas holidays, not launched during them (releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move, denying the products access to the lucrative pre-Christmas shopping period). That nuance seems to have been lost in translation. And beyond this, the article was as we said written in August, at which point a pre-Christmas launch still seemed possible. Now we're pretty much certain that the Retina MacBook Air will have to wait until 2015.

UPDATE, 7 Jan 2015: Sure enough, no MacBook Air appeared over Christmas. The very idea! The latest rumour suggests instead that a radically slimmed-down 12in MacBook Air will launch in mid-2015, perhaps making an appearance at WWDC 2015. See more details and images in the Design section, below.

We've been awaiting the launch of a new MacBook Air for some time. Back in summer 2014 Apple made a few tweaks to the MacBook Air line up, but this was mainly to reduce prices; the processor bump was very slight. Read our reviews of the current MacBook Air range here: 11in 2014 MacBook Air review and MacBook Air 2014, 13in, review.

What people are really waiting for is a new MacBook Air with Intel's (delayed) Broadwell processor, and a Retina display.

The new MacBook Air line up is said to include a completely new 12-inch model which may replace the 11-inch version, giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen, or it may replace the 13-inch model, where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

So when will this new MacBook Air arrive? Reports in mid June suggested that Apple would begin production of this 12-inch MacBook Air in the third quarter. According to a DigiTimes report, Quanta Computer was set to begin production of the new 12-inch MacBook Air in July. This may have started, if the new Intel chips arrived in time...

They may have: Intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new Core M chip that some believe could be used in the new MacBook Air. A number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets, and some of these models will be available in October. According to Intel, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are all using the Core M.

If this new Intel chip is used by Apple, reports suggest that the new Retina MacBook Air will be available in time for Christmas.

In an August report on Digitimes, the Taiwan-based site claimed that its sources in the Taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new MacBook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year, or next year.

However, there are also reports that suggest the new Retina MacBook Air could be delayed until next year - it may not be using these Core M chips, relying instead on a different series of Intel Core i5 Broadwell processors (more on that below).

One report even suggests a mid-2015 launch date, claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours : Redesign, new colours, thinner design
On 6 January 2015, 9to5Mac posted a series of images that it says show the next MacBook Air's radical new design.

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

Bear in mind that these are artist's renders rather than photos of the real thing (although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well done - the artist is Michael Steeber). 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within Apple ""who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer"".

It isn't entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the artist's imagination, although many of the most major changes (to the keyboard layout, for instance) are obviously in the former category.

Sure enough, the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size: 12 inches. Yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in MacBook Air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in MacBook Air. The screen is a little bigger, but everything around the screen has been shrunk.

Here (according to the renders, at any rate) is how the new 12in MacBook Air (left) will compare to the current 11in MacBook Air (right):

New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5mac

This also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these leaks: the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the laptop. It has a USB port on the righthand edge (the new, smaller and reversible, Type-C USB) and a headphone socket, along with a couple of microphone holes, on the left. If this is right, the MacBook will have to be powered via the USB port - and sure enough, USB Type-C will be perfectly adequate for that purpose. It just means that you won't be able to use a USB hard drive, wired mouse (or wireless mouse dongle) or other USB accessory while the MacBook is plugged in.

Macworld contributor Kirk McElhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose, and it's possible - likely, we would say - that the eventual layout will be less extreme. We think the MagSafe power connection is likely to survive. 

As we mentioned briefly, the keyboard is also designed differently. The power button now sits next to the Esc key at the top-left corner of the keyboard, and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together. The trackpad, on the other hand, has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys.

Of course, 9to5mac's images aren't the first apparent leak about the next MacBook Air's design.

Jack Marsh, a 16-year-old blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new MacBook Air, seems to have become the the go-to blogger for all MacBook Air rumours. There have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced Apple products, but as yet we can't be sure the claims are legitimate.

Marsh has a rumour about the MacBook Air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold, silver and space grey finishes (more on that below). Now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin Apple has had to switch to a new reversible USB Type C connector which is significantly smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm).

Apparently the MagSafe port is also getting a redesign for the same reason: the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current MagSafe charger. Indeed the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way, although Marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this had been finalised yet.

The MacBook Air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the laptop. Marsh also claims his source told him: ""The display bezels are noticeably thinner - quite similar to the current MacBook Pro Retina lineup.""

Marsh's earlier report claimed that the new MacBook Air will come in iPhone-like space grey and gold finishes, as well as the usual aluminium.

MacRumors lent some credibility to this inisial report, claiming that they are aware that ""Apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour options"". And it wouldn't be the first time Apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their Mac laptops.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: 12-inch screen
Many of the new MacBook Air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in screen.

Some sources point to evidence that Apple is working with 12in screens, but there have been claims that Quanta Computer will be building a rumoured 12-inch iPad later this year and it could be the iPad Pro that is being referred to here.

According to a DigiTimes report in June, sources claim Apple wishes to introduce a smaller MacBook Air to make clearer the distinction between the 11-inch MacBook Air and the iPad Air with its 9.7-inch screen.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple is working on a new version of the MacBook Air - one with a 11.88in screen. Other rumours place the screen size at 12in (which probably matches Matte's expectations).

In his blog Matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one MacBook Air - this new 12-inch model, with the 13-inch model being phased out in favour of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

The smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller bezel.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Fanless design
The new MacBook Air is also said to be even thinner than the existing MacBook Air. This is based on the theory that it will use Intel's new Intel Core M processor, a chip that doesn't need fans. By using this processor it is claimed that Apple could make the laptop 9mm thin. The MacBook Air is currently 0.3-1.7cm thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point.

Apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the MacBook Air is thicker at one end than the other. Removing the fan assembly would enable Apple to make the laptop thinner than ever, according to reports.

Presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in, but that may not be necessary. The new Intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible - indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan.

Even the Core M may still require cooling in a 12in laptop, though. The new Broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller (up to 11.6in) laptop or mobile device, notes Motley Fool, based on what Intel said at its developer forum in 2013.

It has been suggested that the MacBook Air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal management.

Another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation. There would also be no moving parts (making it less likely to break), and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery.

(We can't help but worry that history could repeat itself if the MacBook Air is fan free - Steve Jobs famously refused to include a fan in the Apple III, leading to hardware failure.)

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: USB Type C
If Marsh's source (above) is correct the new MacBook Air may offer USB Type C support, which is smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm). USB Type C is able to support 10Gbps data transfers, which is twice as fast as USB 3, but still slower than Thunderbolt 2 (although the same as the older Thunderbolt 1).

It will also support for up to 100 watts of power, which is apparently enough to power 4K displays, as Apple's Thunderbolt cable does currently. The only problem is that USB Type C isn't backwards-compatible.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Inductive charging
Marsh's source also claims that the MagSafe port may get a redesign and that the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way. Perhaps the new MacBook Air will use inductive charging like the Apple Watch does.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Trackpad changes
According to a report on Chinese site Weiphone earlier this year, the new MacBook Air will be thinner and lighter, a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad.

The new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce ""force and optical sensors"" and new touch gestures, according to this report from BEN Latest News.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Retina display
Will the next MacBook Air feature a Retina display? That's one of the strongest and most persistent rumours, and it's certainly possible.

Apple may opt to keep prices down (and battery life up) by keeping the screen non-Retina; but we don't think so. According to our own reviews of the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air is currently let down by its display, which has a lower resolution than the competition.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte has written a blog claiming that Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year. He expects that we will see a 11.88-inch model with a resolution of 2,732x1,536 pixels, the same 264ppi that the iPad Air offers.

He explains the significance of Apple using the same display technology for the MacBook Air and iPad Air, stating: ""It turns out that an ~11.88"" Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7"" 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI. It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7"" iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.""

Rumours also claim that the new MacBook Air Retina display could have a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440 for a rumoured 12in display (discussed below). That's 226 pixels per inch, compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in MacBook Pro (which offers 2,560-by-1,600 resolution). This adds up to a 16:10 aspect ratio like that found on the 13in MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in MacBook Air.

The current 11.6-inch MacBook Air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel display.

The rumours of a MacBook Air with Retina display have been long running. Back in February 2013, rumours suggested that Apple was planning to launch a revamped MacBook Air with a Retina display in the third-quarter of 2013. A separate report in March 2013 also claimed that Apple would introduce a Retina display to the MacBook Air in 2013. Since this didn't happen in 2013, it is perhaps likely for 2014. 

Apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to Retina display. The company updated the Retina versions of its MacBook Pro in 2013, and also introduced a Retina iPad mini in October 2013. 

Wondering what the Retina display fuss is all about? Read: What's a Retina display, and what's a Retina HD display?

Apple may use the IGZO display technology for the new display, offering improved power efficiency. The reason for the supposition is that Apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in LED backlighting and LCD displays, in February, according to CultofMac. In an LCD display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them. The backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels. In an IGZO display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires, so the power requirements are lower, and battery life can be preserved. As a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in MacBook Air.

Rumours about a Retina MacBook Air with a smaller display have been circulating for some time. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.

Then back in January 2014, Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang predicted that a 12in MacBook/iPad hybrid would launch in the autumn of 2014. It is possible that the rumoured Retina display MacBook Air could be this Mac.

Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Processor
Intel has announced the new Intel Core M chip. Some expect that this processor may be used by Apple inside the new MacBook Air. As mentioned above, because this chip doesn't need fans, the new MacBook Air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point. Since it uses the 14nm processor, the processor itself it is tiny.

The Core M processor should also enable the new MacBook to be more power-efficient with better battery life. Intel claims it's the most energy-efficient chip yet.

The Core M also offers excellent graphics processing power, according to Intel. Intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of four-year-old machines, and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of high-end tablets.

However, Intel has not confirmed that Apple will use the new processor. (In the press release regarding the new chip, Intel mentions Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba as potentially using the Core M. Some of these models will be available in October, according to Intel.)

The Core M is designed for small laptops, large tablets and 2-in-1 devices, and Intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of 13.3in, tablets above 10in and dual devices. Apple would traditionally use the Core i5 chips in its MacBook, so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a MacBook Air which may instead use the new U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

Redmond Pie reports that performance with the Core M hasn't been particularly impressive; it was featured in the Lenovo Yogo 3 Pro, which didn't exactly set the world alight: benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly. It's therefore been suggested that Apple may give the Core M a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip.

(On the other hand, some analysts have argued that Lenovo's implementation of the Core M, rather than the innate qualities of the Core M itself, was to blame for the sub-standard performance, and that Apple's engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a Core M-equipped MacBook Air. We shall see.)

Whichever Broadwell processor Apple does use, it should make the Retina display MacBook Air possible. Broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor Haswell, and that should be good news for battery life on the portable Macs, especially those with power hungry screens.

Other features of the Broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with WiDi, 4G WWAN and WiGig networks.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: May not use Intel chips
This rumour has been floating around for some time. It is possible that Apple will ditch the Intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own home-made A-series chips, like those found in the iPad and iPhone.  

Some have even speculated that the new MacBook Air could mark some sort of crossover between the iPad and the MacBook, perhaps an iPad Pro.

However, rumours that Apple will move from Intel to ARM chips seem unlikely, based on this explaination from Cult of Mac.

New Retina MacBook Air rumours: UK price
With the price of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display being so close we had expected that Apple would reduce the price of the entry-level MacBook even further. It's currently £749 for the 11in model, which is £100 less than in 2013. This compares to the MacBook Pro Retina starting price of £999. However, the fact that the top-of the range iPhone 6 Plus costs more than the entry level MacBook Air (£789) makes us think that the MacBook Air price is more likely to increase.

It may be that the 13-inch MacBook Air is discontinued, as that model is similar in price to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but not equal in specs. This would leave the cheaper 12-inch MacBook Air models with, potentially, an entry-level price of £800.

When it first launched in October 2012, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display started at £1,449. This was reduced to £1,249 a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade. Now, with the April 2014 update to the MacBook Air, the entry-level price of the 13-inch model is a much more compelling £999 which makes the difference between the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and the 13-inch MacBook Air £250 rather than £150.

In his predictions last year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the price of this new 12-inch MacBook Air model could be lower than the current line up of Mac laptops.

Didn't Apple already introduce the 2014 MacBook Air?
Apple unveiled the latest update to the MacBook Air on 29 April 2014.  Quietly updating its MacBook Air line-up with improved Haswell processors from Intel. You can read our review of the 2014 11in MacBook Air and the review of the 13in MacBook Air here.

Aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak, the main change for the new MacBook Air models was the price. Each model is now under £1,000, with prices starting at £749, £100 less than the previous models. This helps keep the MacBook Air an attractive option for customers, as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.

The range update came as some surprise as the Retina display for the MacBook Air rumour was already in circulation. Prior to the MacBook Air update in April, there were suggestions that the new MacBook Air with Retina display could launch at WWDC, but this was obviously not the case.

Why is the Retina MacBook Air delayed?
If there is a delay, the key reason may be the availability of Intel processors, rather than the production of the new design.

Intel's newest generation of chips - the successor to the Haswell chips currently in the MacBook Air - called Broadwell has been plagued by delays. However, in a conference call about Intel's second-quarter results on 15 July, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich confirmed Intel’s hardware partners will have Broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to Christmas. He said: ""We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday.""

As we mention above, some of these new chips are now shipping, however, anyone awaiting the new Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac mini should note that there are various Broadwell chips being developed by Intel, and the chips that Intel confirmed are shipping now are the M variety, destined for fanless two-in-ones. The new MacBook Air may use the U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.

We are sure that Apple is pretty frustrated with Intel.

Shipment of Skylake – the successor to Broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip - is also delayed.

New Retina MacBook Air release date: Will the MacBook Air be an iPad Pro?
There are also rumours that Apple could launch a 12in iPad, but this might not arrive until 2015, or the rumours could relate to the 12in MacBook.

There are also rumours that the new MacBook Air merge with the iPad to create the iPad Pro. You can read more about the iPad Pro rumours here.

We think that a MacBook Air that offered a dual boot system for iOS 7 and Mac OS X would be very interesting, however, Tim Cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a Toaster Refrigerator wouldn't work.

Will the old non-Retina MacBook Air remain?
If Apple launches a 12in MacBook Air, will it discontinue the existing models? It's possible that if Apple launches a 12in Retina MacBook Air model it will discontinue both, or either of the existing models. Equally, Apple could maintain one of the existing models as an entry-level model. It seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price, rather than keep on the bigger 13in model.

One reason why Apple may keep a lower-priced MacBook Air on is the fact that Apple has just introduced a new entry-level iMac and already the MacBook Air looks superior to that, despite costing less. If Apple wants a low end option, it would appear unlekely that the Retina MacBook Air would be it.

Read our review of the new £899 iMac and see how it compares to the MacBook Air.

The new MacBook Air will be solar-powered
Ok, so this is a bit of an out-there rumour, but it really is possible that Apple will one day release a new MacBook Air with a solar powered display.

In January 2013, Apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a MacBook's display. This patent is actually the seventh solar-related patent Apple has gained in the past two years.

New Retina MacBook Air leaked images
At present, there are no new MacBook Air leaked images to share with you, but we will update this story as soon as one surfaces on the web.

We have seen a few concept images, however...

Perhaps inspired by the Mac Pro, or the Space Grey iPhone 5s, there are calls for a black version of the MacBook Air. TUAW has provided some renders of how such a MacBook Air could look.

A devoted fish owner in Norfolk, England, took his constipated fish to the veterinarian, only to learn that a lump near its backside was the cause.

The procedure was completed at Toll Barn Veterinary Centre by Faye Bethell, according to BBC News. The procedure cost the fish's owner £300 ($460).

""We've got one nurse who bubbles anesthetic gas through a tube that goes in through its mouth and over its gills, and then we have a second nurse to monitor with a probe to check the heart rate,"" Bethell told BBC News.

Goldfish can live between 10 and 25 years in captivity, with some reported to thrive well into their 30s. The constipated fish in question was a spry two years and 10 months old at the time of the procedure.

The goldfish has reportedly since made a full recovery, free to comfortably swim in circles in a tank for the next seven to 20 years.

NEW YORK CITY — The New York Police Department will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession, according to people with knowledge of the city’s drug strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The NYPD will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana — instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct. The summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine.

Few details on the new policy were immediately available, but an official with one of the city’s five district attorneys offices confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Monday that the change “is happening.” The official added that “burning marijuana” would still be cause for arrest, but that having the drug in a public place would not.

The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but are expected to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on Monday.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance​ ​said​ Monday​ he supported the change two years ago and still does. “This policy – by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court – will also keep low-level offenders, particularly teens, from an arrest and all its attendant consequences, including a night or more in jail,” he said.

The new policy, which was first reported by the New York Times, would bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed. Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city’s arrests, a vast majority of which happen to young black or Latino men living in poor neighborhoods.

Some public defenders praised the policy.

“This is a huge improvement,” Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told BuzzFeed News. “Summonses don’t get you fingerprinted. This will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences, like immigrants.”

Still, Schreibersdorf cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the NYPD relaxes its identification requirements for summonses. Immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification, she said, which often means that they cannot be processed for a summons. She added that the policy does not address the root cause of the problem — namely, that police officers in New York routinely stop people without probable cause.

“Having summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped, but that doesn’t mean they should be stopped in the first place,” she said. “The problem, from my perspective, is that stopping people without cause is unconstitutional.”

Advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants, which are issued to people who fail to show to court for a summons. As the New York Times reported, up to a quarter of people issued summons fail to appear for their court appointments. As a consequence, there are currently 1.2 million open bench warrants in New York City — about one per every eight residents.

Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in New York State since 1977. The NYPD made 59,000 arrests for misdemeanor possession in 2010.

Under current law, the only way to get arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for having less than 25 grams of marijuana is to display it “in public view.” The legal definition of that term, however, is ambiguous. “Public view” can mean smoking pot in a public place, but it can also mean that a police officer stopped you, frisked you, and pulled a small bag of marijuana from your pocket.

When the bag leaves your pocket, it has technically entered public view, and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor — even though you had less than the decriminalized amount. This broad interpretation of “public view” helped low-level marijuana possession become one of the NYPD’s most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks.

The correlation between marijuana arrests and stop-and-frisk became apparent after 2011, when a U.S. District Court declared the policing tactic an unconstitutional form of racial profiling. By 2013, the NYPD was making only 28,000 marijuana possession arrests — still a large number, but 47% less than in 2010.

A recent study by the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance found that upwards of 86% of all low-level marijuana arrests made in 2014 affected black people or Latinos — even though national studies have shown that white people are just as likely to smoke marijuana regularly, and slightly more likely to have tried it.

The report also found that the geography of the arrests is highly segregated, with dominantly white neighborhoods seeing fewer arrests than neighborhoods of color with similar per-capita incomes.

These stark race and class disparities in drug law enforcement became a sore point for Mayor de Blasio, who as a candidate promised to end discriminatory policing. They also drove Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, to announce in July that his office would no longer prosecute low-level marijuana possession, opting instead to dismiss most of such cases.

Still, the NYPD defended the high number of arrests, with Willam Bratton, de Blasio’s police commissioner, saying that Thompson’s decision would not affect the NYPD’s approach to marijuana possession. The policy to be announced on Monday will mark the first time the current administration will take concerted action to address the disparities in marijuana arrests.

In an interview with the New York Times, Thompson said he was worried that the new policy could harm those it was intended to help by removing prosecutors from the picture. This is because a prosecutor can opt to dismiss a misdemeanor, but cannot do the same for a violation.

But as new report by the Vera Institute shows, prosecutorial review can cut both ways. The Institute analyzed data provided by the Manhattan District Attorney and found that black people and Latinos were “much more likely to receive a sentence offer including a jail of prison term” than white defendants in similar circumstances.

In the case of misdemeanor marijuana possession, the Vera report found, black people arraigned in Manhattan were 19% more likely to receive jail or prison time than people from all other ethnicities. By contrast, defendants arrested in Brooklyn could expect their cases to be dismissed. The new policy is expected to standardize procedures across the city.

More details on the new policy are expected soon. De Blasio and Bratton are scheduled to make an announcement together Monday at 3 p.m.

1369,"Unconfirmed reports are circulating on social media that the Islamic State group carried out a chemical attack while battling Kurdish forces in Kobani. Several journalists reporting from the ground on Tuesday night -- and at least one Kurdish official -- said they were aware of such reports, but that doctors lack necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of Kurdish victims' complaints. The patients said they had difficulty breathing, and many had burns on their skin, teary eyes and swollen lips. Syria (as well as Iraq) is thought to possess chemical weapons, and the U.S. and coalition forces have feared that such weapons might fall into ISIS hands.

""It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighborhood beforehand,” co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) Asya Abdullah told the Kurdish Question. “Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment or expertise.""

Journalists reporting from the border of Kobani and Turkey reportedly spoke to doctors on the scene who confirmed the PYD’s description of victims. Al Aan TV reporter Jenan Moussa posted on Twitter that a doctor said “victims who are on their way to clinic speak of following symptoms: teary eyes, suffocation and skin burns.” Victims also had “swollen lips,” Moussa added.

Kurdish affairs analyst Mutlu Civiroglu spoke to one of four remaining doctors inside Kobani, who told him all victims were civilians.

“Several patients came to health center at 11:10pm with burn in the throat & as well as complaining about headache, though their situation is NOT very severe,"" Dr. Ahmed reportedly told Civiroglu. ""We are NOT sure what the cause is yet, but we are planning to send affected patients to Suruc [neighboring city in the Turkish side of the border] in the morning for further examination.”

Reports of a similar chemical attack surfaced last week in Kobani, when several Kurdish fighters’ bodies appeared to show signs of blistering.

“Burns and white spots on the bodies of the dead indicated the use of chemicals, which led to death without any visible wounds or external bleeding,” Kurdish health minister Nisan Ahmed told Middle East Review of International Affairs journal.

There have been rumors that ISIS militants have obtained chemical weapons. Given that Kobani is on the Syrian border with Turkey, the weapons could have come from an undisclosed Syrian stockpile that used to belong to the Damascus regime.

After the Bashar Assad regime carried out a chemical attack that killed nearly a thousand people last year, it was forced to dismantle and surrender stockpiles. A year after the attack though, the U.S. State Department said that a “number of critical issues remain unresolved” about the Syrian president's chemical weapons.

The substance allegedly being used in Kobani has yet to be confirmed. However, there have been several chlorine attacks in Syria since Assad was supposed to have surrendered his weapons cache. Chlorine is not banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention but when used in large concentrations it can be weaponized. Symptoms of chlorine attacks include teary eyes, a burning sensation in the throat, the sensation of suffocation and a headache.

ISIS has been battling Kurdish fighters in Kobani for over a month, trying to consolidate territory from their de-facto headquarters in Raqqa to the Turkish border. Despite an increase in U.S-led coalition airstrikes and aid drops aimed at pushing insurgents back and helping Kurdish fighters, the battle for Kobani continued Tuesday night."
1370,"ESPN continues to try to thread the needle between holding the NFL to account for its handling of various domestic abuse scandals and maintaining its $15 billion broadcasting deal with the NFL that keeps everyone involved in the manner to which they’ve grown accustomed. This self-contradiction was encapsulated in the suspension of Bill Simmons for opining on what ESPN’s own reporting had concluded about the NFL.

In that spirit, ESPN will feature Monday night a Deep Meaningful on domestic violence (not the network’s first). But per Esquire’s Ben Collins:

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis. Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24. When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.

Collins reads this as part of a widespread practice at ESPN of marginalizing female voices, a tendency that enables the network to submit to the powerful league at the moments when it most needs its editorial independence. Read the full piece.

1371,"Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.
Trying to console a distraught young boy whose dog had died, Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St. Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.”
While it is unclear whether the pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which saw them as a repudiation of conservative Catholic theology that says animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.
“My inbox got flooded,” said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States.
Charles Camosy, an author and a professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke “in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics.”
But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Camosy said, “In a word: Absolutely.”
To some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest to a saddened child that his lost pet had a place in the afterlife.
Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.
The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America, the Catholic magazine, said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation,” even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals.
The question of whether animals go to heaven has been emotionally debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Pius IX, who led the church from 1846 to 1878, strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness.
Laura Hobgood-Oster, professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, said: “Historically, the Catholic Church has never been clear on this question; it’s all over the place, because it begs so many other questions. Where do mosquitoes go, for God’s sake?”"
1372,"Claim: Eleven passenger planes are missing from an airport in Libya.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, September 2014]

Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli.

Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news.

The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides — the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport — the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft.

1374,"LONDON — The man in the black balaclava who has seemed to have beheaded several foreign hostages in Islamic State videos has been identified by British security services as Mohammed Emwazi, a British national from London.

Known in the news media as “Jihadi John,” he is said to have been born in Kuwait and traveled to Syria in 2012. His name was first published on Thursday on the website of The Washington Post.

The story was confirmed by a senior British security official, who said that the British government had identified Mr. Emwazi some time ago but had not disclosed his name for operational reasons.

Mr. Emwazi, 27, grew up in Queen’s Park, West London, and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming.

He first appeared in Islamic State videos in August, when he appeared to behead the American journalist James Foley and deliver threats against the West. The actual execution was not included in the video.

1376,"The Department of Homeland Security definitively debunked the persistent right-wing media conspiracy theory that Islamic State fighters have attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the rumor is not supported by any ""credible intelligence"" and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as ""categorically false."" 

What began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) that ""people that are coming [across the U.S.-Mexico border] from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations,"" (a claim PolitiFact Texas rated ""Pants on Fire""), has morphed into a full-blown right-wing conspiracy theory. Conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) terrorist group are utilizing the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the U.S. and launch terrorist attacks, a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform.

In September, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) claimed to have seen information detailing ""four individuals trying to cross through the Texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the Middle East,"" a story subsequently hyped by Fox News. Nearly a month later, the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to 10.

Fox News' On The Record provided a platform to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border. Host Greta Van Susteren replied to Hunter's allegations by asking, ""Do you have any information, or any evidence, that they are actually coming in the southern border now?"" And Hunter responded, ""Yes. ... I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" citing information he'd received from border patrol agents.



But the right-wing talking point is ""categorically false,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security. On October 8, DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron refuted the rumor that Islamic State terrorists had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, telling The New Republic: 

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

It remains to be seen whether DHS's facts permeate the right-wing bubble. After hearing the DHS statement, Sean Hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying."
1377,"An article saying a “planetary alignment” on January 4, 2015, “will decrease gravity for 5 minutes” and cause partial weightlessness is fake.

Every year, there’s been rumors about a so-called “planetary alignment,” but they’re obviously fake.

The hoax originated in the 1970s when British astronomer Patrick Moore made it up, telling his radio audience that the alignment would result in a gravitational pull that would make people lighter at 9:47 a.m. local time.

As Time magazine noted in a 2011 article:

The British media have a unique affinity for pulling April Fools’ pranks, matched only by the British public’s unique ability to fall for them. On April 1, 1976, BBC Radio 2 astronomer Sir Patrick Moore gave listeners some bunk about how, at 9:47 a.m., Pluto and Jupiter would align in such a way as to temporarily reduce Earth’s gravity. Moore told listeners to jump at exactly that time to experience the once-in-a-lifetime effect. At 9:48, callers flooded the lines, eager to describe how they had briefly floated. News that Moore had played them no doubt brought everyone crashing back to earth.

A few days ago, fake news website Daily Buzz Live posted a variation of the hoax, which generated tens of thousands of Facebook shares in a short time. It reads:

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

The solider killed today by a masked gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Canada, has been named locally as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, while a deceased suspect has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Cirillo, 24, a reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders within the Canadian Armed Forces, was shot in the chest by the assailant. He was put in an ambulance but latter “succumbed to his injuries”, Ottawa Police said.

The shooter then jumped into a car and sped off, though whether this gunman was behind the shoot-out at the Canadian Parliament minutes later is still unconfirmed. An assailant who entered Parliament was shot dead by sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers.

A Canadian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the dead suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, Associated Press reports, but could not give more details on a possible motive nor details of his background.

However, local reports say that Zehaf-Bibeau was Canadian-born, while Reuters have reported that he was a convert to Islam and was from Quebec.

Earlier today at a press conference following the dramatic incident in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said: “I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial.

“Remember how that one person's life has been taken from us - from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”

As reported by CBC News, Cirillo was just one of the guards on duty, who make up of a larger roster of soldiers that rotate on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They also carry unloaded rifles.

Officials also said that the incident ""caught us surprise"", despite the government upgrading its terror threat from low to medium a day prior due to ""general chatter"" online from jihadist groups including Isis.

An Facebook group in memory of Cirillo has already had over 10,000 followers, with friends and acquaintances of the solider reportedly emailing in their memories of him.

A comment on his profile picture on Facebook reads: “RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you.”

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.

Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.

The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.

Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term ""Brat Pack"" being coined.

In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.

1383,"The former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee who says Comcast got him fired from his job set an Oct. 14 deadline for the company to respond to his demands of a full apology and a monetary settlement, and got a half-assed apology instead. Two days after the deadline passed, he stuck to his word and filed a lawsuit.

Conal O'Rourke is going after Comcast and its controller, Lawrence Salva, for defamation, and arguing the company violated federal regulations with its poor service and overbilling.

In his complaint, O'Rourke alleges that Salva, a former partner at PWC, called up an executive at PWC's Philadelphia office and used Comcast's leverage as a major client to have O'Rourke investigated for ""ethics violations"" and ultimately fired.

O'Rourke says Comcast and Salva defamed him by telling his employer he threw PNC's name around on the phone in an attempt to get his Comcast service issues resolved—he claims he never told anyone at Comcast who he worked for, and he wants Comcast to release tapes and emails from his interactions with the controller's office prove it.

Oh, and about those service issues: O'Rourke's complaint also argues Comcast's mistreatment of him as a customer violated the Cable Communications Policy Act, and lists some particularly egregious examples:

Comcast habitually misspelled Mr. O'Rourke's name as Mr. O'Kourke, making it difficult for him to receive his Comcast bills in a timely fashion, because the postal service would fail to deliver them. Ultimately, Mr. O'Rourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to ""Mr. O'Kourke,"" after he was unable to convince Comcast to even correct the spelling of his name.

In addition to Comcast's continual failure to address Mr. O'Rourke's billing issues, in late November or early December of 2013, when Mr. O'Rourke was out of town, Comcast shipped Mr. O'Rourke twelve random pieces of Comcast equipment. Comcast then proceeded to charge Mr. O'Rourke almost $2,000 in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted.

When he tried to get help with these issues, he says, Comcast sent him to collections. That's when he took his complaint directly to the controller, and allegedly lost his job as a result. He says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a Comcast customer.

Although O'Rourke originally said he would sue to get his job back, the complaint simply asks for legal fees and damages—i.e., the lost wages from the six months he's been unemployed—and an injunction stopping The Worst Company in America from overbilling customers.

Good luck with that last part."

1385,"A DESPERATE mother was tricked into feasting on cooked meat from the body of her son by Islamic State militants, it has been claimed.

The famished Kurdish mother had gone to plead with the jihadists to release her son.

Cruel militants delayed talks with the elderly mum – feeding her a meal made with the corpse of her offspring while she waited.

The depraved story was relayed by a brave Briton fighting on the front line with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State, also referred to as IS, ISIS and ISIL.

Yasir Abdulla left behind his wife and children at their Yorkshire home for six months to battle for his Kurdish homeland.

The 36-year-old said the disturbing story was the cause of his hatred against IS – and one of the reasons he has vowed to return to his war-ravaged native county and ""finish the job"".

The father-of-four told The Sun: ""I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe.

""Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.

""The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were so kind.

But security guard Mr Abdulla then adds: ""They had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just EATEN him'.""

""They burn people alive, they chop off people's heads, there is no limit to their depravity.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.""

The shocking account is just the latest in a string of disturbing executions and punishments administered by the immoral group.

In February, IS released a highly-choreographed propaganda film showing Jordanian fighter pilot Lieutenant Mouath al-Kasaesbeh soaked in fuel and being burned alive inside a cage.

Another video from the organisation showed a man believed to be gay thrown from a seven-storey building. The 50-year-old man, who was blindfolded throughout his sickening fall, is seen to be still alive after hitting the ground below.

He was later stoned to his death by a waiting mob.

Some have interpreted the perceived increase in brutality from the Islamic State as a sign of their weakness.

The terror organisation have suffered a number of defeats recently, including the loss of two strongholds in Iraq.

Last week, Kurdish gunmen stormed the town of Tel Hamis and fought back control from Islamic State rebels.

The group, aided by US-led coalition airstrikes, previously won back the seized border town of Kobani.

Infamous Islamic State militant Jihadi John, who is believed to have orchestrated the beheadings of dozens of hostages, was last week unmasked as a hypocritical cannabis smoker from west London.

Fearless Mr Abdulla, speaking after temporarily returning to his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, said: ""IS are very good at making people scared.

""If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.

""But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us.

""If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can't happen. The Peshmerga [Military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan] can't wait to take the fight to IS.

""We know we can win."""
1388,"A homeless man who became a YouTube sensation after he spent a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends has received a surprise meal, makeover and hotel stay in a new video released amid claims it is a hoax.

The short film posted by 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin shows Thomas, a man living on the streets of California, being taken to a sushi restaurant before staying in a hotel room complete with a hot tub on Christmas Eve.

After a night's sleep the filmmaker then takes him to a hairdressers for a haircut and then to a mall where he buys a new suit.

The videos, that have gained more than 26million views, are part of a campaign to raise more than $120,000, via an Indiegogo page for Thomas to get his life back on track.

But now, viewers have questioned its authenticity, citing a number of apparent flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's newsest video, homeless Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover

Comfort: After living on the streets of Los Angeles, he is also seen spreading out on the white sheets of the bed in his luxury hotel room

Luxurious: He is also shocked to find that the accommodation comes with an enormous hot tub

While sitting in his luxury hotel room in the new clip, Paler Lin asks Thomas what he would do with $100,000.

In line with the gesture to his homeless friends in his first videos, he says: 'When I come into some money I am going to go to three shelters that helped me out and I am going to buy a bunch of bus tickets for people.

'This is what these people need. They've got places to go medically or where they can get help from an agency.

YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.

One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.

Before his haircut he said he was upset at how grey he had become and how long his hair had grown

A store attendant stands alongside Thomas in the mirror as he admires one of the number of suits he tried on during a visit to a mall

Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin

Gesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money

Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)

Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube

Profitable: Some have highlighted the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from the film's success - up to an enormous $52,000 (above, in red), according to socialblade.com , which tracks YouTube channel statistics

'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.

'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.'

Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.

'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.

Fine dining: Thomas is pictured tucking into a Christmas meal in another photo posted on Lin's Instagram

In good spirits: Alongside the picture, YouTube personality Lin wrote: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal'

Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas: 'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve'

A strange choice: One YouTube user questioned Thomas's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away (pictured) for his food shop - as opposed to a nearer supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'

Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.

The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.

Why did Thomas buy food from a liquor store, not a cheaper grocery store?

Why did he stop at a shop a 34-minute walk from the park instead of the shop closest to the park?

If Josh Paler Lin’s business is to make viral-hit videos, why did he set out to ‘expose’ a homeless person spending $100 on booze?

Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.

'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said.

He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart.

After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.

However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.

Criticism: One Twitter user, with the handle Cornelius, said the video would shortly be 'exposed as fake'

Joking: One British user joked that he was heading off 'to create a fake homeless friend' and then appeal to locals for donations - following in the wake of Lin's successful fundraising on Indiegogo for Thomas

Casting doubt: Another YouTube user (pictured), with the handle, ClemtheRanter , said Lin is a well-known prankster whom previously worked on a Halloween-themed video with him that was 'set up' to gain traffic

History of fakes? 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a Halloween-themed bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin'. Above, footage of the apparently 'fake' eyeball prank

'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper.

'That would go with the staging thing because it's like, ""oh look at that, it's a happy twist ending"", and that would make people share it.'

However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'

When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.

But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.

You're welcome: In Lin's homeless video, Thomas apparently begrudgingly accepts the $100 cash from him

Next: The beggar then walks into a Liquor Mart, where he purchases food for his beggar friends, not alcohol

Giving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in

‘I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn’t,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'

However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.

Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.

'[Lin] knows what makes people share videos. He knows all the tactics, probably,' added the user.

Other social media users have pointed out that the video apparently cuts several times as Paler Lin speaks to him by the side of a busy road, meaning he would be able to edit out bad acting.

Candid camera: Lin eventually approaches Thomas to reveal he has been followed. Thomas appears shocked

Grateful: Lin says he was shocked at how the experiment turned out - and has defended its authenticity

And some have said that Thomas's reaction to the camera - 'oh yeah' - was not very realistic.

After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn’t expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'

He added: 'I’m so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel.

'I did not only just help a homeless man, but I actually met an incredible human being and a friend. We were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so.'

In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.

Another video: In November 2013, Lin (pictured, left) gave another homeless man (right) $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. The video gained far fewer views than Thomas's

A kind gesture: Again, the beggar handed over some cash (left), prompting the actor to hug him (right)

So taken aback by what happen, Paler Lin said he later took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night. He also gave him an extra $100 cash.

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' he said.

Since uploading the video, Paler Lin has posted a number of photos of Thomas to Instagram, including the beggar dressed in a suit and eating a couple of Christmas meals.

He captioned one of the images: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal!'"
1392,"Israel has rejected allegations by government officials in the Gaza strip that authorities were responsible for released storm waters flooding parts of the besieged area.
""The claim is entirely false, and southern Israel does not have any dams,"" said a statement from the Coordinator of Government Activites in the Territorities (COGAT).
""Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel.""
At least 80 Palestinian families have been evacuated after water levels in the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) rose to almost three meters, .
The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Sunday that civil defence services had worked alongside teams from the Minsitry of Public Works to evacuate families to shelters in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighbourhood sponsored by UNRWA, the UN Relief and Works Agency.
Brigadier Gerneral Said Al-Saudi, chief of the civil defence agency in Gaza, told Al Jazeera: ""More than 40 homes were flooded and 80 families are currently in shelters as a result.""
He added that the flooding would adversely affect local agriculture as the area included Gazan poultry and animal farms.

According to the site, Abrams had said it himself while addressing a group of attendees at the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards about his frustration about the leaked pictures floating around the web. The site also states that Disney is taking Abrams’ request very seriously.

The site does not specify as to what date Abrams is asking for. Disney has not commented on the rumor.

1395,"Apple has asked its suppliers in Asia to make a combined five to six million units of its three Apple Watch models during the first quarter ahead of the product’s release in April, according to people familiar with the matter.

Half of the first-quarter production order is earmarked for the entry-level Apple Watch Sport model, while the mid-tier Apple Watch is expected to account for one-third of output, one of these people said.

Orders for Apple Watch Edition – the high-end model featuring 18-karat gold casing – are relatively small in the first quarter but Apple plans to start producing more than one million units per month in the second quarter, the person said. Analysts expect demand for the high-end watches to be strong in China where Apple’s sales are booming.

Apple Watch Sport will start at $349. Apple hasn’t announced pricing for the other models, but Apple Watch Edition is expected to be among the most expensive products the company has ever sold, likely surpassing the $4,000 Mac Pro computer.

Apple sets production plans based on its forecast of demand for the new product. But Apple quickly adjusts these plans if sales are different than what it estimated. Suppliers say that Apple adjusts its so-called “plan of record” more often and more quickly than any other consumer-electronics company.

The orders are similar to early sales of Apple’s last major all-new product. Apple sold 7.5 million iPads in the six months after it arrived in April 2010.

They indicate that Apple expects its watch to far outpace other wearable devices, from Samsung Electronics 005930.SE -1.31%, LG Electronics 066570.SE +1.15%, Sony, Motorola MSI -0.77% and a host of fitness trackers. Research firm Canalys said last week that just 720,000 smartwatches powered by Android Wear, Google GOOGL +0.60%’s operating system for wearable devices, shipped in the last six months of 2014.

Apple declined to comment.

Apple Watch is the company’s first all-new product since the iPad. During development, the company studied a wide range of advanced health features for the Watch before scaling back its ambition for a device that does a little bit of everything.

Taiwan-based Quanta Computer 2382.TW -0.75%, the sole assembler of Apple Watch, started mass production of the new gadget earlier this year. To get ready for the April launch, thousands of Chinese workers will continue to work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta’s factory in Changshu, China, said one person."
1397,"eBay may be developing an app for the Apple Watch which ties to its existing iPhone and iPad software, as per a job listing AppleInsider highlighted yesterday.

Originally posted to eBay’s careers webpage in November, the ad was spotted recently on LinkedIn.

The ad states the bespoke Watch app is being developed by the company’s New Technology Group, which employs over 200 engineers in product development in Portland.

An ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app,” reads the ad.

That line led AppleInsider to theorize that “Apple Watch owners may never need to worry about being outbid in an eBay auction again.”

It’s interesting that eBay’s New Technology Group will also be developing solutions for CarPlay and Apple TV. As you know, Apple’s media-streaming box currently does not allow third-party apps.

The Group will be “exploring other opportunities within the Apple ecosystem,” too.

CEO Tim Cook came clean on the Apple Watch release date: in an earnings call yesterday, he finally confirmed that the wrist-worn device, which starts at $349, will hit store shelves in April.

Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac, who was adamant the Watch would arrive in March, recently learned from unnamed sources the Watch was capable of two and a half hours of gameplay or app use, three and a half hours of standard app use and four hours of fitness tracking, as of 2014.


But as Apple continues to optimize the Watch software and hardware ahead of April launch, it’s entirely possible its engineers will be able to squeeze more juice out of its battery than originally thought.

Dodging battery life questions since its unveiling, Apple would only vaguely confirm that fans will have to charge the Watch overnight."
1398,"""At least 10"" Islamic State (ISIS) fighters were captured trying to cross the Mexico border into Texas, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California claims, but the Department of Homeland security has called his statements ""categorically false.""

Hunter told Fox News he learned the information from the Border Patrol, saying ""they aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""
Vote Now:
Story continues below video.



The Border Patrol ""caught them,"" Hunter said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" 

A senior Department of Homeland Security spokesman said Wednesday that suggestions that people with ties to ISIS have been apprehended at the southwest border are ""not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground.""
Special:
The spokesman also said there is no credible intelligence suggesting any terrorist organizations are ""actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information about the individuals ""with known ISIS affiliations"" came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol,"" and the congressman is merely ""conveying what he knows, and what he was told.""

Kasper said ""the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing. It's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" 

Hunter is not alone in saying the Islamic State agents have crossed the border. Last month, former CIA agent Bob Baer told CNN that there are already ISIS cells in the United States, and he has learned from intelligence services that some of the extremist group's agents have crossed the Mexican border. 

While DHS maintains there is no evidence that anyone with terrorist ties has come across from Mexico, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged to Fox News last week that four men with suspected ties were stopped at the border and questioned, although officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""

Johnson also emphasized at a hearing last month that there was ""no specific intelligence or evidence"" showing the Islamic State is trying to come across the Mexican border.

National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen, during the same meeting, said there have been some ISIS sympathizers posting social media messages, but ""we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives"" across the border."

1401,"Rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has not been spotted in months, went into overdrive on Friday night due in part to an unrelated death thousands of miles away.

As the #RIPFidel hashtag began to spread online, it became clear that rumors of Castro's death were being fueled by the high-profile death of a different man with the same name, half a world away.

Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of prominent Kenyan politician and former prime minister Raila Odinga, reportedly died on Jan. 4. His Cuban namesake, however, still appears to be very much alive.

It is with profound sorrow that my wife Ida and I announce the untimely passing of our eldest son, Fidel Castro Odinga.

— Raila Odinga (@RailaOdinga) January 4, 2015

Thousands of mourners took to social media with the hashtag #RIPFidel, as they paid their final respects to the Kenyan Fidel ahead of his funeral Saturday, likely fueling rumors about Cuban Fidel's death.

Fidel Castro Odinga is a high-profile person in Kenya because of his father's political status, so many used social media in the wake of his death to express their condolences, including current Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.

My condolences go out to the former PM @RailaOdinga and his family. This is a big loss not only to you & your family but the entire country

— Uhuru Kenyatta (@UKenyatta) January 4, 2015

Reports of Fidel Castro's death have been a staple of the international rumor mill for years, with speculation on the former Cuban leader's status bubbling up every few months.

There is no indication that the 88-year-old Castro is on his deathbed. However, he last appeared in public on Jan. 8, 2014 at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21, 2014. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

In 2006, a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president, and hand over leadership to his younger brother Raul Castro.

Some of the speculation was prompted by Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

On Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites, such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las America, that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

One CNN journalist added fuel to the fire, tweeting that a speech from Raul was imminent, although he later retracted the information, citing ""bad info from Reuters.""

1405,"Mexican authorities have discovered six hidden graves that may contain the bodies of more than 40 university students who went missing a week ago after clashing with local police in the violent state of Guerrero.

The semiofficial National Human Rights Commission said Sunday that experts will conduct DNA tests in an attempt to identify bodies found in the graves. It was not yet clear how many bodies were present.

Guerrero state Health Minister Lazaro Mazon said nine bodies, burned beyond recognition, were recovered from the muddy pits in the first series of exhumations. He said it could take two weeks before identifications are made. Later, state prosecutor Inaky Blanco said 28 bodies had been recovered, in various conditions.

Frantic parents who have been demanding the return of their children attempted to reach the site of the makeshift graves, near a slum on the outskirts of the city of Iguala, about 80 miles south of Mexico City. They and supporters blocked major highways in the area for several hours.

“You took them alive, we want them returned alive,” read a huge banner unfurled across the highway that leads from Mexico City to Acapulco.

On Sept. 26-27, Iguala city police attacked a group of students rallying against government policies. Six people were killed, more than two dozen injured and more than 50 students vanished. About 15 students eventually were found hiding in their homes, but 43 remained missing. Within days, 22 police officers were arrested for what prosecutors said was use of excessive force.

Parents and surviving students have said they last saw some of the missing being taken away by police. Several parents offered up license plates of the police vehicles that took away their children.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the local police corps was thoroughly penetrated by criminal organizations, at whose behest the police may have been acting. He said that after the discovery of the graves, an additional eight people were arrested. He did not identify them.

If the graves turn out to contain the students, it will suggest that they were summarily executed by their captors, be they police or cartel criminals. And if that proves true, it would constitute the most egregious human rights atrocity in the 2-year-old government of President Enrique Peña Nieto and one of the worst in recent years.

The students were from a special kind of rural university in the town of Ayotzinapa, near Iguala. They had a contentious relationship with authorities and often spearheaded demonstrations.

After they went missing late last month, the federal government dispatched army, navy and national police to take over the search. The federal prosecutor’s office took charge of the case as soon as the graves were discovered late Saturday.

“Mexico cannot let such a serious incident go unpunished,” Tomas Zeron, head of investigations from the federal attorney general’s office, said.

More than 20,000 people are registered as having disappeared in Mexico in the last eight years, giving rise to an intense citizens’ movement to find them. Most never reappear."
1406,"Police will stop arresting people for low-level possession of marijuana and will instead simply issue a summons, sources said.

The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio are prepared to initiate a change in policy that would drastically reduce the number of arrests for possession of pot, according to law-enforcement sources.

The department had already been halting its pot “buy and bust” operations, a crime-fighting staple that often led to gun seizures and arrests for outstanding warrants, The Post had earlier reported.

Sources said that the “powers that be,” including City Hall, wanted to see a decrease in arrests for pot because they have “disastrous consequences’’ on police relations with minorities.

Blacks and Hispanics have accounted for 86 percent of low-level pot busts this year, according to the Marijuana Research Project.

At a press conference scheduled for Monday, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton are expected to announce the key aspects of the policy change.

1407,"A 71-yr-old Catholic priest, John Micheal O’neal has claimed that God is a woman, with a warm and with a comforting motherly figure.
John Micheal O’neal from Massachussetts was said to have been declared dead for more than 48 minutes, he was miraculously revived by medics and had woken up with a shocking revelation that he had gone to heaven and met God.
Reports say Father O'neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.
But with the aid of high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.
It was gathered that doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.
The elderly priest claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.
He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.
“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”
It was learnt that declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston."

While he didn't make it to the police station before noon Monday, police confirmed shortly before 5 p.m. that Constantine was in custody.

""Rodney Constantine has kept his word to us on Facebook and turned himself over to police just now so that the outstanding arrest warrants could be executed. He will be seen by a provincial court judge in the morning,"" the RNC posted.

Constantine was wanted on charges of assault, breach of probation, breach of recognizance and failure to appear in court.

According to police, Constantine is also facing outstanding Highway Traffic Act matters.

Constantine followed up his initial Facebook post by adding he wasn't joking or taunting police.

""Look just letting everyone know this ain't a joke or intended !!!! I was just been honest about turning in Monday morn that's all !!!!!,"" said the Facebook comment.

Mr Ilic told the medics that he felt his small sized penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend and as it was useless decided to cut it off.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade, which was also lying in the bin.

Although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they did not have the competence to reattach it.

The sister, who belonged to an order in Macerata, in the eastern Italian region of Le Marche, claimed to have no idea she was pregnant when she was rushed to hospital in agony, after which she gave birth.

The South American nun, who arrived at the convent in June, when it is supposed she was already pregnant, was taken to the emergency department of 'Bartolomeo Eustachio' di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters.

The childbearing nun, originally from South America, claimed to have 'no idea' she was pregnant

Doctors quickly unravelled the cause of the mysterious ailment, Il Corriere Adriatico reported.

The baby was born healthy but remains in hospital to undergo more checks, while the nun's convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him, according to L'Unione Sarda.

The case bears a striking similarity to that of a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun in Italy, who gave birth to a baby boy last year, whom she named after Pope Francis.

She told her social worker she did not feel guilty and would raise the child saying: 'I am so happy. 'He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun.'

In 2011 a Congolese nun in an Italian order gave birth to a baby girl after being raped by a priest.

She gave up the baby for adoption but after being refused re-entry to the convent changed her mind and recovered the child."

1415,"Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, “Spring Forward,” is an apt time reference.

Suva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. A flurry of fashionable accessories including various colors and materials (plastic, leather, and metal, including high-end metals such as gold, silver and platinum), starting at $29 and ranging over several hundred dollars. We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use). Purchase locations to be Apple retail stores and Apple online store only. Hundreds of applications immediately available upon release, ranging from social, financial, health, sports and news etc.

Apple is more likely to benefit from continued iPhone 6 sales, Suva opines. Still, the WTch is among things that expand its addressable market:

We do note Apple is actively expanding its total available market (watches, payments, automotive etc). We expect Apple to sell 3.1M watch units in the June qtr, with a F12M est of 17.1M watch units.

Apple stock on Thursday closed up $1.62, or 1.3%, at $130.41."

In the statement, Barbara Henning says that she had just received a audio file of her husband pleading for his life. She then goes on to appeal to the terrorists' internal sense of justice:

I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State (ISIS) over Alan's fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear. He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.

We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.

I have been told that he has been to a Sharia Court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system.

Please release Alan.

Earlier on Tuesday, militants with ISIS released a new propaganda video in which another British hostage, John Cantlie, compares the fight against the militants to the American quagmire in Vietnam."
1417,"For the last few weeks, the general public has assumed that Tiger Woods hasn’t been playing on Tour because of his back and a dog shit golf game, but PGA Tour golfer, Dan Olsen — don’t worry, I haven’t heard of him before either —  is saying that’s simply not the case. Olsen went on record, during a radio interview with 730 WVFN’s David “Mad Dog” DeMarco, claiming his sources are telling him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one month suspension for failing a drug test. Later in the interview, Olsen says his sources are “Tour players that are exempt.”

Per Olsen’s interview with 730 WVFN:

“I heard he’s on a month suspension. And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

Olsen didn’t stop at PED’s. He even goes as far as claiming Tiger Woods has allegedly been using questionable golf balls since the late 1990s. So questionable, in fact, that Nike has paid PGA Tour staff to pick up all the balls so no one get’s the balls.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now. One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

I have personally seen Rory McIlroy throw his golf balls into the stands, so I don’t know how valid this ball claim is. But, WOW. Dan Olsen must have very few fucks left to give if he’s publicly calling out Tiger Woods as a cheater on multiple levels.

Thanks to BroBible writer and PGA Tour caddie, Pinot Pete, for getting this interview on our radar. And while Pinot Pete could not corroborate Olsen’s claim — nor would he probably want to, because LAWSUITS — he did say, “I’ve known Dan Olsen for 10 years. And in all that time, I’ve never known him to stretch the truth.” So there’s that."
1419,"Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.

Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said.

""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Who are Boko Haram?

Who are Boko Haram?

Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants."
1420,"The Apple Watch is the most buzzed about wearable to hit the market in a long time, and not all of the buzz is good. We've shared some of th earlier rumblings about the Apple Watch's short battery life. Now we are hearing news of a new feature called Power Reserve, which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the Apple Watch run on low energy while only displaying the time.

The Apple Watch's battery life is expected to only last a day. This puts it at the bottom of the pack for iOS smartwatches. Even with a Power Reserve function, the battery is significantly lagging behind the Pebble Time's seven day battery life. Even before wearables came on the scene, not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight. One of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email, text, or actually make a call.

If the expected battery life is only one day, then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage. Imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged, then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday. This means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge it.The allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket. If the Apple Watch isn't on your wrist, will you be drawn to look at the notifications?

Can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night? The Power Reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life. It's still better than a running out of juice. Without a charge, a dead Apple Watch isn't even a watch. It's just an expensive bracelet. Perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers Apple has at its disposal. We'll let you know all the emerging details leading up to Apple's big event on March 9th, 2015.

1422,"The tweed-wearing germ-hater smacked two women around the head after they sneezed in Carlisle town centre

Detectives are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping High Street shoppers in his town if they SNEEZE.

In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle on Monday.

Then on Tuesday, officers believe the same man launched a second attack on a frail pensioner who also had a bout of the sniffles.

In that shocking incident an 82 year-old woman who had just sneezed was slapped over the head in broad daylight at 11.30am in Scotch Street, Carlisle.

Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket.

Getty   Attack of the sneezes: Police say the incidents were 'very unusual'

The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them.

They have been informed about the first attack by witnesses - but have yet to trace the first female victim.

However the force said they are investigating two head-slapping incidents - and believe they are related crimes.

Sgt Gill Cherry said: “We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

“It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.”

Shoppers in Carlisle said they were bemused but frightened by the oddball’s behaviour.

Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, said: “We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

“When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it’s not your fault.”

Worried dental receptionist Nicola Dawson, 48, who was visiting from nearby Kendal, said: “I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold.

“If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back."""
1423,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon says U.S. officials have confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabaab terror group in a U.S. airstrike on Monday.

The Pentagon's press secretary confirmed the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane in a brief written statement Friday.
""Godane's removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,"" the White House said in a statement.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda.

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabaab's top explosives expert.

Al-Shabaab gained international notoriety a year ago this month when it attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people. The U.S. strike on Monday targeted Godane and other planners of the bloody assault on the mall, officials said."

Abdel-Majed Abdel-Bary

12.14 The telegraph's Richard Spencer reports:

Identification of Mohammed Emwazi as ""Jihadi John"" means it is not the British-born rapper, Abdel-Majid Abdel Bary, who was once suspected of being the killer-propagandist.

Abdel Bary's route to radicalisation was easily traced, in the lyrics of the songs he performed as L Jinny, as he became disillusioned with a drug-fuelled lifestyle on London's streets.

His father, Adel Abdel Bary, was one of Britain's best-known jihadist sympathisers, who came to London in exile from his native Egypt. He spent 13 years in jail awaiting extradition to the United States, where he was accused of links to the 1998 embassy bombings by al-Qaeda, and where he made a plea bargain and was sentenced to 25 years in jail this month.

Abdel Bary's role as a jihadist in Syria is not in doubt, however - he tweeted a picture of himself holding the severed head of a prisoner in Raqqa, Syria, saying: ""Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him"".

But she said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigation, or indeed the safety of British citizens.""

Asked if the naming had undermined the current investigation, she said: ""We are not going to go into the details, but there is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and keep British people safe.""

""We are absolutely determined to bring the perpetrators to justice, and the police and security agencies are working hard to do that.""

His vice-president, Jamal Achchi, 26, also has links to the group, raising concerns that the university’s student union has been taken over by extremists.

In the past members of the group have been accused of encouraging street violence against non-Muslims and of sexism and homophobia.

The Prime Minister has said the group should be banned as it ""seeks to poison young minds against our country"" although the government has not yet taken action.

11.22 The Independent newspaper reported in a story in 2010 that two British jihadists had been stopped by MI5 in Tanzania. In the article, Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. It claims that Emwazi was put on a terror watch list by MI5:

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

11.18 Immediately after the Washington Post published the name, the BBC also released a story, explaining they had chosen not to unmask Jihadi John earlier for operational reasons.

He was apparently raised in a middle class neighbourhood in north London and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. Friends told the Post that Emwazi began to radicalise after a planned safari to Tanzania following his graduation from Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends were arrested in Dar-es-Salaam in May 2009 and then deported. He then flew to Amsterdam where he apparently claimed an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to join al-Shabaab.

Interestingly, iGen.Fr also relays that Apple may still be trying to push for a release before Valentine's Day. This however is at odds with a previous report claiming that Apple is planning to release its highly anticipated wearable device this spring.

As with any anonymous rumor, the aforementioned pricing matrix should be taken with a grain of salt, especially because pricing is one of the few details prone to changing at any time.

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man’s attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots — a cluster of six, followed by four.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” the man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN’s Don Lemon. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man’s recording late last week from a mutual friend.

“I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,” Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It’s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'”

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown’s death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown’s body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson’s credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn’t understand why some are questioning his credibility.

“I see they bring up my past, my history, but it’s not like it’s a long rap sheet,” Johnson told Lemon/ “This one incident shouldn’t make me a bad person.”"
1427,"None of the 28 bodies found in a mass grave in restive southwestern Mexico belongs to a group of 43 missing students, Mexico's attorney general said on Tuesday.

The students, who are feared to have been massacred by police in league with gang members, went missing in the southwestern state of Guerrero on Sept. 26.

The discovery of a series of mass graves near the town of Iguala, where the students went missing, has sent shockwaves throughout Mexico, where around 100,000 people have died in drug-related violence since 2007.

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo said none of the charred remains found in the first mass grave matched genetically with the missing students.

""What I can say is that the first mass grave we found, the very first ones from where we already have results, I can say the (remains) don't match the DNA of the families of these young people,"" he said. But authorities had found another mass grave near the site, Murillo said, and were now checking those remains. He also said that 14 more police officers had been arrested following the earlier arrests of at least 22.

1429,"A homeless man who received a surprise meal and hotel stay after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends has insisted that no part of the experience was a hoax - despite the fact one witness is claiming the whole thing was a set-up.

The man - named only as Thomas - had been filmed living on the streets of California, before being taken to a sushi restaurant, given a hotel room with hot tub and treated to a new suit and haircut .

But the resulting video posted online by 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin was met with varying degrees of skepticism, with a number of viewers dismissing it as a hoax.

One witness, in particular, has insisted that there was no way that Thomas did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as Paler Lin.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's newsest video, homeless Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover

Nursing student Taugan Tan Kadalim, 26, told Vocativ that he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw Paler Lin - who is recognized from his previous videos - in the driver's seat.

In the passenger seat, he claims, was Thomas.

Kadalim told the site: 'While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.'

However, Thomas has now spoken to Fox LA, insisting that to him it was 'all a surprise' and he had never met Josh before he was handed the $100.

He told the news channel: 'I appreciate it, most definitely. It's all a surprise to me. I thought this was just a project video, I had no idea this was going where it went.

Thomas added: 'Normally people give you a dollar, maybe five as a big tip, but a hundred, wow that's a week's worth. Crazy.'

Paler Lin had initially set out to 'expose homeless people' in Los Angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol.

However, Thomas proved to be an exception. Instead, he spent the money on food to share with his friends, prompting Paler Lin to return and surprise Thomas with a Christmas meal, makeover and a night in a hotel.

Gesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money

The feel-good videos, that have gained more than 26million views, are part of a campaign to raise more than $120,000, via an Indiegogo page for Thomas to get his life back on track.

But critics pointed to a number of apparent flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000

YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.

One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.

Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas: 'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve'

Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)

'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.

'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.'

Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.

'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.

Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube

Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.

The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.

Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.

'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said.

He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart.

After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.

Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin

However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.

'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper.

However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'

When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.

But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.

'I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn't,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'

Giving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in

However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.

Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.

After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn't expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'

He added: 'I'm so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel.

In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Paler Lin said.

1430,"Nigerian officials Friday announced they had agreed to a cease-fire with Boko Haram, but their statements left confusion over the fate of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militant group in April.

Defense chief of staff Alex Badeh announced the truce, saying all Nigerian military units had been instructed to abide by the accord.

Women attend a demonstration in Lagos, Nigeria, calling on the government to rescue schoolgirls kidnapped by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram.
Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, said there was also an agreement for the release of the captive girls following talks with Boko Haram representatives mediated by officials from Chad, new agencies reported.

But Nigerian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the schoolgirls' release was still under negotiation, the Associated Press reported.

Nigerian officials haven’t commented on what was being offered to Boko Haram in return for the girls’ freedom. The group has previously demanded the release of prisoners as a condition for freeing the hostages.

Nigeria’s military announced months ago it knew the location of the girls but said it would not launch a military operation to recover them because of the risk of casualties.

A government spokesman, Mike Omeri, told a new conference Friday that Boko Haram representatives said during negotiations that the girls were in good health.

Analysts were cautious about the news, with Nigerian officials reporting countless false dawns in its long confrontation with the militant group -- and with Nigeria facing presidential and parliamentary elections in February. Jonathan is expected to announce in coming weeks that he will run for a second term.

There have been several efforts in recent years to negotiate peace with Boko Haram, which has battled the army for control of northern Nigeria and sought to impose a strict form of Islam in the region. None of the attempts has come to anything.

Jonathan, desperately in need of some good news, has faced harsh criticism over his slow response to the girls’ abduction. His supporters accuse the #BringBackOurGirls campaign of being opposition stooges, using the girls’ fate for political mileage.

Hundreds more women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram in recent years – and dozens of schoolboys and teachers were killed by the group that opposes secular education and other aspects of Western culture. But the mass kidnapping in April and the BringBackOurGirls hashtag coined by Nigerian activists attracted global attention to the schoolgirls’ plight.

The schoolgirls had gathered at a lightly guarded boarding school on the outskirts of the town of Chibok for their final exams when the attack happened. Gunmen loaded 276 girls into trucks and drove away. Parents and local officials accused Nigeria’s military of failing to pursue and recover the girls.

According to Nigerian officials, 57 escaped and 219 remain in custody.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau later released a video describing the girls as slaves and threatening to “sell them in the market.” A video of the girls reciting the Koran and dressed in Islamic clothing was also released.

Nigeria, a country of 170 million, is roughly divided between the north, which is predominantly Muslim, and the mostly Christian south.

Boko Haram emerged over a decade ago in response to Nigeria’s corrupt ruling class and opposes what it sees as the taint of Western influences such as taxation, democracy and automatic teller machines. It has become increasingly fragmented in recent years, with some factions opposed to the group’s violent attacks on Muslims.

Boko Haram’s assaults initially focused on police stations and military posts. In recent years, the group has stepped up its violence, killing thousands of people in attacks on villages, churches, schools, markets, open-air video entertainment venues, bus stations and other crowded public places."

The site's sources, which are often reliable, suggest that the event might take place during the last week of February, potentially on Tuesday, February 24.

The event may see Apple once again showcasing the Apple Watch, which is set to debut in April, and it may also see the launch of the 12-inch MacBook Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that the upcoming notebook will debut in March, which is in line with a late-February unveiling.

Rendering of the 12-inch MacBook Air by Martin Hajek
Apple's 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to feature a new ultrathin design that does away with fans and introduces a revamped trackpad. It may include a low-power Core-M processor and it may be the first device to take advantage of the new reversible USB Type-C connector, which is much smaller and allows a USB cable to be inserted into a notebook in any orientation.

Apple may also use the event to unveil additional details on the Apple Watch, such as pricing and battery life. An event showing off the Apple Watch could explain why Apple has been asking some developers to have their apps ready to launch in the App Store in mid-February, as we reported last week. It's possible that Apple will use apps from these developers to demonstrate additional capabilities of the watch.

Though rumored, a February event is by no means confirmed at this point, and it is unclear what else Apple might cover in addition to the Apple Watch and the 12-inch MacBook Air.

Update 12:23 PM: Sources speaking to 9to5Mac have indicated Apple will not be holding a late February media event.

1436,"Users on Twitter and Facebook this week are saying parts of Texas are now under Sharia law, or Islamic law.

The whole thing appears to be an unfounded rumor that was twisted around when conservative news website Breitbart published an article that says, “ISLAMIC TRIBUNAL CONFIRMED IN TEXAS; ATTORNEY CLAIMS ‘IT’S VOLUNTARY.'”

Some users and other blogs went along with the story but apparently misinterpreted its premise.

The article reads:

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

According to the Islamic Tribunal’s website, it appears to deal mainly with divorce. However, people apparently thought the organization was trying to interpret a Saudi Arabian- or ISIS-style version of Sharia law, complete with executions, restrictions on women, and other forms of punishment.

The Islamic Tribunal, on its website or in the Breitbart report, never said it was trying to overrule existing federal, state, or local laws and replace it with its interpretation of Sharia law.

So yes, while there is a Islamic Tribunal, all American citizens have to adhere to the laws of the U.S. first and foremost. No other entity can supersede that.

A few weeks ago, Facebook said it would attempt to clean up its news feed for users by offering them the ability to report fake news stories or hoaxes.

Hoax-Slayer’s Brett Christensen told Epoch Times that regarding the Facebook change, “I don’t think the changes will backfire as such, but it remains to be seen how effective they are. After all, Facebook is not actually going to delete the fake-news posts. It will just slow their distribution if a lot of people report them as fake news. A lot of people believe and share the stories, so they are not likely to report them anyway.”

“And, despite the false news annotation that Facebook is promising to display on reported posts, many people will likely share them anyway.”"

A terrorist struck at the heart of the nation Wednesday, gunning down a sentry at the National War Memorial and wreaking havoc on Parliament Hill where the marble and stone halls echoed with gunfire and ran with blood.

The gunman was shot and killed near the Library of Parliament, reportedly by House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former RCMP officer, and the man responsible for security on the Hill.

It appears the gunman walked right past the Centre Block’s Reading Room, where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with his caucus Wednesday morning.

Citing U.S. intelligence sources, CBS identified the attacker as Canadian-born Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32. That had not been independently confirmed.

The fatal showdown in Centre Block followed the cold-blooded slaying of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo standing guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a short distance away from Parliament Hill.

That soldier, a reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, based in Hamilton, was shot at close range in front of the war memorial at 9:52 a.m. He was rushed to the Ottawa Hospital’s Civic Campus, but did not survive his injuries.

It was unclear whether the gunman was acting alone or was joined in his attack by others, but after the attack, the gunman fled toward Parliament Hill, according to witness accounts.

Parliament Hill and large swaths of downtown Ottawa went into lockdown as Ottawa police, the RCMP and special forces pursued confusing and unconfirmed reports of gunshots near the Rideau Centre and the Chateau Laurier. At one point, officials believed at least three gunmen could be involved.

It was still unclear by late afternoon Wednesday just how many people took part in the attack, but police said there had been no shooting near the downtown mall after all.

City Hall, the Ottawa courthouse, Lisgar Collegiate and the University of Ottawa were among the many institutions that went into emergency lockdown. The NHL postponed an Ottawa Senators game scheduled for Wednesday night, and the National Arts Centre cancelled two performances.

Inside Parliament Hill, a gunman — likely the same one who shot the National War Memorial sentry — stormed into Centre Block where the NDP and Conservative caucuses had convened for 9:15 a.m. meetings. The Liberal caucus was meeting in the basement.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper was with his party’s caucus when the gunman entered the second floor of Centre Block, but was escorted to safety by his RCMP security team.

Across the hall, in the NDP caucus room, about 100 MPs and aides piled tables and chairs in front of the doors after they heard gunshots crash through Centre Block just after 10 a.m.

“A series of gunshots rang out and we realized they were right on the other side of the door,” NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Citizen.

Parliament Hill security officers rushed politicians out of the building, Liberal MP Marc Garneau among them. “You could smell the gunpowder,” he said.

Security officers pursued the gunman in the Hall of Honour, near the Library of Parliament, and exchanged a hail of gunfire. One guard was wounded in the confrontation that killed the terrorist.

It’s believed Vickers fired the shots that killed him.

A video shot by Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove showed crouching RCMP officers moving through the main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.



“I am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino said on Twitter.

Justice Minister Peter MacKay offered similar praise: “Thank God for Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our Canadian security forces.”

The injured guard was taken to The Ottawa Hospital with a non-life threatening leg injury. The Ottawa Hospital also treated two other people injured in the incident.

The attack was the most serious security breach of Parliament Hill since 1966, when an unhinged man, Paul Chartier, tried to blow up 10 sticks of dynamite on the floor of the House of Commons. He killed only himself when the explosives detonated before he could throw them.

Wednesday’s shooting at the National War Memorial represents the second time this week that a Canadian soldier has come under attack on national soil.

On Monday, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau, of Saint-Jean-sur-Richeleau, southeast of Montreal, used his car to assault two Canadian soldiers, one of whom later died of his wounds. Rouleau was a convert to Islam whose online postings had become so radical that the RCMP confiscated his passport.

The attacks could be a reaction from homegrown extremists to the federal government’s decision to join the international coalition battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the Middle East. Parliament approved a motion to launch a combat mission against ISIL earlier this month.

“Canada will not be terrorized or intimidated,” senior Conservative cabinet minister Jason Kenney declared in a Twitter message.

Wednesday’s attack began on the ground of the National War Memorial, dedicated to all of those who have fought and died for this country.

Witnesses said the long-haired gunman, dressed in a dark hoodie, blue jeans and wrapped in a scarf, opened fire on one of the two guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The gunman used a long rifle of some kind, possibly a shotgun.

Construction worker Matthew Blais was working near the East Block when he heard what he described as a bunch of “pops.”

“I looked over at the War Memorial and I saw a man with a rifle shooting at innocent people,” Blais said. “We ducked for cover.”

Raivo Nommik, a lighting designer, was walking past the National War Memorial when the shots were fired: “(The soldier) was shot at close range: It couldn’t have been more than 20 feet.”

Tourist Jan Lugtenborg, of the Netherlands, said he was waiting near the memorial for a tour bus. “Then all of a sudden this happens: I heard four shots. I thought it was a firework,” he said. Lugtenborg said he saw a man with long, black hair running with a rifle. “We were scared like hell so we ran back,” he said.

Chaos ensued. Witnesses don’t agree on what happened next. Some said the gunman ran toward Parliament Hill. Others said he carjacked a vehicle first. Blais said he saw the man jump into a green car. “He parked right in front of Parliament and ran into the building,” he said.

Another witness, Construction worker Scott Walsh, was working near the East Block when he saw a man run on to Parliament Hill, carjack a vehicle from a man in a dark suit, and drive it to the Centre Block.

The NDP’s Angus described the wild scene inside the party’s caucus room after the first shots were fired on the Hill.

“We put up these flimsy little tables to get people behind and get them under chairs,” he said. “We wanted to make sure that everyone was safe. Security came in fairly fast — I was surprised how fast they came — and I could see from the look in their eyes that they were very worried. We know them. We talk to them every day. They wanted us out of that building.”"
1446,"On Monday evening’s CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon debuted a recording that allegedly contains audio of the gunshots that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown earlier this month.

On August 9, police officer Darren Wilson shot Brown at least six times during an incident in Ferguson, Mo. Several witnesses claim the young man was fleeing the officer, and had his hands in the air when the fatal shot was delivered; but police officials claim Brown had violently attacked Wilson who then responded in self-defense.

An unidentified man claims to have recorded the gunfire — haphazardly, it seems, as he is heard talking about unrelated matters. At least 10 gunshots can be heard in the background, with a brief pause between the first seven and the last four or so.

Before airing the audio, Lemon cautioned his audience: “CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape. [We have] reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording.”

Count this audio as yet another chapter in the media’s running book of scoops that were unverified but provided for ample cable news fodder.

The thing is, while there were several different versions of the Apple Watch mentioned, only one price was stated – which pointed to the $349 starting price, and we still have zero idea on how long the battery is going to last, and neither do we have a bucket list of its features. Analyst John Gruber has rolled up his sleeves and figured out that the Apple Watch Edition might just cost $4,999, coming in 18-karat gold/sapphire to boot.
As for the other estimates that analyst John Gruber has come up with, the normal aluminum/glass Apple Watch Sport ought to be the one that sports a $349 price tag, while those with three times more disposable income can settle for the predicted $999 price tag for the Apple Watch with stainless steel/sapphire.
But how did Gruber arrive at the $4,999 price point for the Apple Watch Edition with 18-karat gold/sapphire? Simply because he thinks it will be a solid gold piece, and not gold-colored. Those who have seen the Watch Edition and touched it purportedly claimed that it is heavier compared to the stainless steel version, which means the materials used within could cost a bomb – as reflected in the possible price tag. What do you think of Gruber’s estimates?"
1453,"This picture of a penis spraypainted on a £1.5 million Bugatti Veyron is being shared like crazy this week.

LOOK – it’s a penis on a really expensive car!!!

According to this Reddit post four days ago, the image was taken in downtown Seattle.

[Insert outrage/uncontrollable glee here]

The thing is, the graffiti appears to be the work of YouTube pranksters TwinzTV.

Here’s Instagram user andreysmygov revealing that the spraypaint was for an upcoming video.

And here’s the car with different graffiti on it.

The TwinzTV Instagram account is also trailing an upcoming video using the supercar.

These are the kind of “pranks” the YouTube channel uses the Bugatti Veyron for.

On Wednesday, Andrey seemed to be enjoying all the attention the picture had received.

He included the caption: “A little joke goes a long way haha.”

The video including the penis graffiti has yet to surface on the TwinzTV channel."
1455,"A report on Thursday claims the upcoming Apple Watch boasts a mysterious data connection port, previously undisclosed by Apple, that is currently being used for diagnostics and testing.

According to TechCrunch, the port features six brass contact dots and is positioned inside the bottom groove designed to accept Apple's aftermarket straps. Technically, a six-contact connector is similar to Apple's Lightning protocol, which currently uses six of its eight leads for charging and data transfer.

It is not clear if the port will be included when Apple Watch hits store shelves, but sources inside Apple have confirmed its existence on what the publication believes are shipping versions of the device.

A source said the port currently plays a role in diagnostics, but points out that it could be used as a connection point for accessories in the future. TechCrunch speculates that such a data port could be used as a means to facilitate feature expansion, perhaps ""smart bands"" that extend battery life or tack on GPS and other sensing capabilities.

Smartwatch maker Pebble recently revealed a similar program for its new Pebble Time series. Dubbed ""smartstraps,"" the initiative is an open platform that will let accessory makers build hardware like GPS or heart rate monitoring.

There are currently no rumors suggesting Apple plans to market such accessories, but the port's existence hints at interesting expansion possibilities, assuming it ships as part of Apple's final design. For example, an expansion port could extend the Watch's lifecycle by offering users a road to upgrade features instead of purchasing a new device every year. This would be especially helpful for buyers looking at expensive gold Apple Watch Edition models.

Apple is expected to reveal more details about Apple Watch at a special event on March 9. AppleInsider will be on hand in San Francisco with live coverage."

Eyewitnesses said the gunman allegedly ran towards nearby government buildings where police chased him and around 30 shots were fired inside.

They added that some people inside the Canadian parliament fled by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations.Police said they are still actively looking for one or more suspects.

The area was placed in lockdown and local TV reported that more shots had been heard before the gunman was killed.Emergency responders are attending and the shooting happened at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. Paramedics later took the wounded soldier away in an ambulance.

The spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the politician was safe and had left Parliament Hill.While Tony Clement, a senior politician, tweeted that shots were fired near where cabinet was meeting in Parliament. Mr Clement posted: ""Shots fired during caucus meeting. at least 30 shots. MPs piled out. I'm safe with 2 colleagues but we're still at risk...""

He later added: ""I'm with colleages Mark Strahl and Kyle Seeback. PM was in Caucus but now secure. Assuming it's not safe to venture out yet...""

1458,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model."

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.
On the tape, you can hear six shots being fired, a short pause and than an addition four or five shots. An autopsy report released last week said that Brown was shot at least six times.

1462,"Nurses found the woman - who is believed to suffer mental health problems - biting her new son on the arm

Shocked medics have described the moment they found a mum apparently trying to EAT her baby days after he was born.

A nurse found the woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, with her jaws clamped firmly around the infant's arm.

She raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, but the mum refused to let go.

Doctors were forced to use an implement to prize her off the child before administering a sedative.

The shocking cannibalistic attack happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China’s Guangdong Province, where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street.

CEN   Investigation: Hospital bosses are now trying to decide whether to return the baby to the mother

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm.

A hospital spokesman said: ""It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.

""Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.

""After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""

CEN   Tragic: Doctors said the woman had been living on the street before she gave birth

Police said the woman had been identified as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua.

They said enquiries had found that, despite being pregnant, her mother-in-law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly.

The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help.

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman's actions and whether the child should be taken into the care of the authorities."
1463,"Apple may be planning to hold a media event in late February to showcase the final version of its upcoming Apple Watch, and also debut a newly redesigned MacBook Air, potentially with a Retina display, according to a new report.

Word of a potential late-February event was reported on Wednesday by French Apple publication iGen, citing unnamed sources. Specifically, it was said that Tuesday, Feb. 24, could be a likely date for such an event to unveil upcoming products.

Rumors have suggested that Apple will launch an all-new 12-inch MacBook Air with a thinner chassis this quarter, which concludes at the end of March. A late February event could set Apple up to debut the new MacBook Air within that timeframe.

It's expected that the redesigned MacBook Air will sport a high-resolution 12-inch Retina display. There have also been claims that the device will feature the new, smaller, reversible USB 3.0 port.

As for the Apple Watch, although Apple offered a preview of the device and its appearance last September, the company has been working behind the scenes to finalize the hardware and software ahead of its launch in April. A February event could give Apple an opportunity to offer more specifics on the upcoming wearable device, such as battery life.

Another potential product unveiling could be a so-called ""iPad Pro,"" rumored to feature a 12.2-inch display. However, it's been reported that the device may not launch until the second quarter of 2015, making it potentially a candidate for WWDC.

Apple hasn't held a major event early in the year in a few years, instead waiting to unveil new products at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The last time Apple held a major product unveiling event in the first quarter of the calendar year was for the third-generation iPad in 2012.

iGen has a respectable track record in predicting Apple's future plans. Last fall, the site got its hands on Foxconn schematics that showed the final design of the iPhone 6, and the site also predicted the launch details for Apple's latest-generation handsets."
1465,"North Korea's Kim Jong-un has piled on so much weight that he has fractured both his ankles and remains in hospital after an operation, it was reported today.

The leader of the impoverished nation is estimated to have ballooned to 20 stone as a result of fine wining and dining - putting enormous pressure on his feet and legs.

A source who has recently returned to the South Korean capital, Seoul, from the North said Kim, believed to be aged 31, is still in hospital under guard from his personal protection team.

Scroll down for video

Propaganda: His love of rich food, combined with clocking up the miles in his frequent public walkabouts, have resulted in fractured ankles for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

Hungry, sir? Kim Jong-un inspects a dining room at Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army in North Korea

Bodyguards have been posted around the ward of the Pyongyang hospital and security remains tight, the source told Seoul's Chosun Ilbo newspaper.

'There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,' said the source, whose comments were supported by an intelligence official in Seoul who said Kim's official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Obese Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions.

'He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power,' said the un-named intelligence official.

In a clip from North Korea's Central TV, shown recently, Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment, but the date of he appointment was not known.

There have been earlier suggestions that Kim's obesity and binge drinking have brought on gout which confined him to his residence for several days.

His aides, however, were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper reporting that he had 'laboured on' by visiting various facilities, braving the hot summer weather.

An Antonov An-2

The North Korean military has turned its ageing fleet of Soviet-era aircraft into low-tech stealth bombers using wood and fabric.

Troops have stripped the metal parts off Antonov An-2 biplanes and replaced them with wooden propellers and a cloth fuselage - similar to the early warplanes of the First World War.

The lighter materials mean the aircraft, first produced in 1947 and mainly used as light transports and crop dusters, less likely to be picked up on radar.

It is thought the £18,500 planes would be used as bombers should war break out with mortal enemy South Korea.

North Korea' air fleet, though large, spends most of its time grounded thanks to shortages of spare parts and a crippling lack of fuel.

A team of doctors from Europe reportedly went to North Korea recently, leading to suspicion that would have flown half way across the world only to treat someone in high authority

Added to the belief that Kim was still in hospital after having operations on his ankles was the fact that he had missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday.

According to a Seoul government official who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo it was unlikely 'that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.'

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by State TV which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

It has also been reported that a team of doctors from Europe went to North Korea recently, leading to suspicion that would have flown half way across the world only to treat someone in high authority.

A political observer in Seoul said the only real way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles was to live a more simple life 'coming down closer to the level of his people.'

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s."
1466,"Rumors that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in an airstrike circulated on Iraqi social media Sunday, along with a photograph purportedly showing the bloodied jihadi leader.

The speculation was backed by several unconfirmed Iraqi media reports, which maintained that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago. However, later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington’s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes — since the US air campaign began on August 8 — had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

“We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

“The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam — and the flooding that might result — would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,” he added.

AFP contributed to this report.

1467,"A report that says a family in the town of Purdon, Texas has got the Ebola virus and the town was quarantined is fake.

It was posted on the National Report, a satirical website.

The bogus report says: “The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus. Purdon is located just 70 miles from Dallas, Texas, and the hospital that has cared for both American Ebola patients, Thomas Eric Duncan, and Texas nurse, Nina Pham.”

Thomas Eric Duncan and Nina Pham have in fact be diagnosed with Ebola, with Duncan dying earlier this month. Duncan traveled from Liberia, a country that’s been hard-hit by the virus, to the US and he apparently came into contact with Pham.

However, the report goes on to say that a man contracted the virus, which is fake.

The National Report doesn’t currently have a disclaimer since it was taken down a few months ago.

It used to read: “*DISCLAIMER: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.

Hoax-debunking site Snopes.com also has a writeup on the bogus report, which says: “In just a few hours, the Texas quarantine article was shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook. However, National Report is a fake news site that publishes sensational, made-up stories such as “15 Year Old Who ‘SWATTED’ Gamer Convicted of Domestic Terrorism,” “Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say,” and “Vince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6.” While the yarn about additional Ebola cases in Texas is not nearly as lighthearted and perhaps more plausible than those japes, it’s still completely fabricated.”"
1468,"An Iraqi official denied that a woman detained in Lebanon is a wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, adding that she is the sister of a terror suspect being held in Iraq.

Wednesday's denial comes a day after Lebanese authorities said they are holding a woman believed to be al-Baghdadi's wife.

They said she was detained for travelling with a fake ID and had herself claimed that she is the reclusive extremist leader's spouse.

This file image made from video posted on a militant website purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq

The statement by Iraq's Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim adds to the confusion surrounding the identity of the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID.

Lebanese officials said the woman, Saja al-Dulaimi, is believed to be the wife of the reclusive IS leader. She was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida branch, earlier this year.

The interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor.

It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.

On Wednesday, Ibrahim told The Associated Press that al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national who traveled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon, is not al-Baghdadi's wife. He identified her as the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is being held in Iraq as a terror suspect.

He added that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al-Dulaimi. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese authorities.

In Lebanon, a military expert was killed and two others wounded Wednesday when a bomb they were about to dismantle near the border with Syria exploded, the army said.

The explosion comes a day after an ambush by suspected Islamic militants in the same area killed six soldiers and wounded one.

No one has so far claimed responsibility for Tuesday's ambush or for planting the bomb that was discovered Wednesday.

Lebanese troops have been battling Syria-based Islamic militants, including the extremist Islamic State group and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, in areas near the border.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry spokesman said police have not ruled out the possibility that Islamic State group supporters were behind the shooting of a Danish man last month.

It was the first time a Saudi official publicly comments on the incident since a video was released by alleged IS supporters claiming responsibility for the drive-by shooting in Riyadh Nov. 22. The Danish citizen survived the shooting.

Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki's comments were published Wednesday in the Saudi Al-Eqtisadia newspaper.

The video was released online this week by a group purporting to be IS supporters. It shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing at the driver. It identifies the target as Thomas Hoepner. It was not immediately possible to confirm the authenticity of the video.

Foley was a freelance photo journalist covering the civil war in Syria at the time.


IS has held him ever since, but today they tweeted out video of his beheading.

They want publicity from this barbaric act, and I’m loathe to give it to them even by writing a few words about it.

But their barbarity needs to be exposed.

President Obama is reluctant to do anything about the Islamic State’s spread, other than to order airstrikes. Over the past few days, those airstrikes have helped the Kurdish and Iraqi forces fight IS. Iraqi forces recaptured the strategic Mosul dam.

But IS is far from broken. They still hold Mosul and several other Iraqi and Syrian cities. They are still capturing Iraqi Christians and Yazidis and reportedly selling captured women into sex slavery. They are murdering people by the dozens, by the hundreds. IS has designs on consolidating its power in Iraq and Syria and using that as a springboard to attack the United States and Europe. Tellingly, the murderer in the IS video of Foley’s execution — which I won’t post here — has a British accent.

IS is still holding American journalist Steven Sotloff. They have tweeted photos of him kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, next to a probable executioner, and declared that his life depends on what President Obama does next."

Vickers' younger brother, John, tweeted that his thoughts are with his brother and that his family is being contacted by media around the world.


During his nearly three decades with the RCMP Vickers, who is now 58, rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick. Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms, Vickers was director of security operations for the House of Commons. He has provided security for dignitaries and as an RCMP officer, Vickers was responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

Vickers was the RCMP commander during a series of tense standoffs between officials and Mi'kmaq fishermen in Burnt Church, N.B. in the 2000s. The First Nation objected to federal fisheries' limits on how many traps they could set, leading to blockades and confrontations.

""Despite the incredible tension, Inspector Vickers was always respectful, accommodating, and cool under pressure,"" said Huffington Post B.C. news editor, Andree Lau, who was a CBC reporter in New Brunswick at the time.

He applied that same professionalism to all issues, big and small, said Lau.

""He took that kind of care to treat everyone fairly, whether it was a vandalism complaint or if it was a major criminal issue. And that was vital in a small region like Northern New Brunswick,"" she said.

1473,"An Iraqi airstrike on Thursday (September 4th) killed Abu Hajar al-Souri, a top aide to ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"" (ISIL) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Iraqi Ministry of Defence said.
""The Iraqi army air hawks were able to make a direct hit on one of ISIL's main strongholds in Tal al-Rumman, west of Mosul, killing Abu Hajar al-Souri, the right arm of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and those with him,"" the ministry said in a statement released by Al-Iraqiya state television.

The airstrike killed ""seven prominent leaders in the group, most of them Arab and foreign fighters"", ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Askari told Mawtani.

""Abu Hajar is considered a key leader in the group and the second-in-command for planning and executing terrorist operations,"" the spokesman said. ""He used to move between Iraq and Syria on an on-going basis to follow up on the group's members.""

The army plans to release additional details about the operation after carrying out the necessary investigations, he added.

Deputy Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Hamed Attia said the air raid ""took place after days of surveillance, information-gathering and communications intercepted by locals about the presence of al-Souri in the region"".

Attia said the attack was the fruit of security co-operation with citizens.

Iraqi MP Hassan al-Sunaid described the air raid as a positive step.

""The death of Abu Hajar al-Souri will be welcome news for the thousands of families of terrorism victims, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis displaced because of ISIL,"" he said.

1477,"We've heard rumors for some time that Apple's been less than pleased with the purported battery life of its upcoming Apple Watch. And now, it looks as though it has plenty of reason to be worried. According to a new report from 9 to 5 Mac, the Apple Watch the battery is looking at just 2.5 to 4 hours of ""active application use"" before it dies. Yeesh.

According to 9 to 5 Mac's report, while Apple (along with everyone else who's had their eyes on one) was hoping its Watch would last for at least a full day on a single charge, it's had to significantly change its tune thanks to the power-sucking Retina screen and A5 processor:

As of 2014, Apple wanted the Watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active/passive use, 3 days of pure standby time, or 4 days if left in a sleeping mode. Sources, however, say that Apple will only likely achieve approximately 2-3 days in either the standby or low-power modes…

But if you're hoping to use the Apple Watch for fitness tracking, there is (sort of?) better news: ""Apple expects to see better battery life when using the Watch's fitness tracking software, which is targeted for nearly 4 hours of straight exercise tracking on a single charge. "" Which, sure, is better than the two-and-a-half hours you'd get under normal heavy use, but there's no way this is going to be tracking more than the lone workout.

As a point of comparison, the Moto 360 easily lasts a full day of mixed-use. Our own Eric Limer's watch still had a little under half of its battery left after about 16-hours of wear. Even the Samsung Gear S, which is essentially a full-fledged phone for your wrist, can go a full day easy. And of course, the Pebble Smartwach, which is admittedly a very different beast, can last close to a full week on a single charge.

Still, while these numbers certainly seem awful, most people probably aren't going to be browsing Facebook and playing games on their wrist four hours. Apple expects most people to be wearing the Watch passively for the majority of the day, but while they were originally shooting for about 19 hours of ""mixed usage,"" 9 to 5 Mac's sources say that Apple no longer thinks it can even hit that—at least not in this first generation.

We've reached out to Apple for comment, and will update as soon as we hear back. [9 to 5 Mac]"
1478,"Dylan Thomas found the spider had burrowed its way through a scar

A young Australian man picked up an unwanted souvenir in Bali last weekend when he found that a tropical spider had burrowed under his skin and travelled up his chest.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was on holiday with friends when he woke up one morning to find a red, scar-like trail on his stomach.

He was initially given antihistamine cream to treat what doctors in Bali thought was an insect bite. But the red trail spread upwards and by Monday it had started blistering so he was sent to see a dermatologist, who discovered the small tropical spider and removed it.

The doctors said the spider had burrowed through a small scar left by a previous operation to remove his appendix.

Thomas has since returned to his home in Western Australian. He told local media NT News: “It was bigger than the size of a match-head.”

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days” he said.

The staff at Bali International Medical Centre have taken the spider away for testing and will let Thomas know what kind of spider it is next week."

Unbridled daily binges on Emmental imported from Switzerland are believed to be responsible for the dictator’s rapid weight gain, with some defectors speculating he was trying to match the considerable bulk of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung.

And South Korea’s largest newspaper claims that the tubby tyrant is in fact recovering from two fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury – and caused the bones to crack.

‘I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,’ an unnamed source told Chosun Ilbo.

The source added that the 31-year-old had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Kim, who has not been seen in public in almost a month, missed a session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang for the first time since ascending to power in 2011, sending the gossip mill into overdrive.

The North Korean leader, pictured, is reportedly keen on opening a restaurant in Scotland offering traditional dishes native to his country

The 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants already has branches in China and Asia, with proceeds from the business being funnelled back into North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He explained: 'It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

'The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

'Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

'Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.'

Kim Jong Un pictured visiting a mushroom farm in Pyongyang in a picture released last week. As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese

The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to North Korea, added: 'They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

'They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.'

Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months.

She added: 'North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.'

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30 per cent of takings back to Pyongyang.

But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-Un’s own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

1488,"The man who breached security at the White House this month overpowered a U.S. Secret Service officer and ran through much of the main floor, penetrating farther into the building than previously disclosed, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing three people familiar with the incident.

“The Secret Service has no comment on that at this time due to the ongoing investigation,” Brian Leary, a spokesman for the agency, said of the Post story. A White House spokesman declined comment.

The suspect, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. Officials said he was carrying a knife when he jumped the White House fence and entered the executive mansion on Sept. 19.

A prosecutor said in court last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete in Gonzalez' car.

Gonzalez, a decorated Iraq war veteran, had been arrested in July with a sniper rifle and a map on which the executive mansion was marked, the prosecutor said.

The Post said Gonzalez ran past a guard immediately inside the door, past the stairway leading up to the Obama family's living quarters and into the East Room, where he was tackled at the far end of the room by an agent.

The alarm box near the entrance, designed to alert guards to an intruder, had been muted at what officers believe was the request of the usher's office, the Post said, citing the Secret Service official.

The officer posted inside the door appeared to be delayed in learning the intruder was about to come through, the Post said. Officers are trained to lock the front door immediately if they learn of an intruder on the grounds.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is expected to face questioning at a congressional committee hearing on Tuesday.

1489,"The Islamic State killer Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi, from west London, it was reported on Thursday.

Emwazi was known to British security services but they chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons, it is claimed.

He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, or Isil, the group terrorising Iraq and Syria.

Jihadi John first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

The IS terrorist apparently studied computer sciences at Westminister University.

The Washington Post describes Emwazi as Kuwaiti born and in his mid-20s.

He was apparently raised in a middle class neighbourhood and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

Friends told the Post that Emwazi began to radicalise after a planned safari to Tanzania after he graduated from Westminster.

• Who is Jihadi John?

• Does Jihadi John have a body double

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""The man known as Jihadi John rose to notoriety when he first appeared in a video posted online in August, in which he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in all black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and American aid worker Peter Kassig, as well as footage of Mr Henning's death.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

""There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.""

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ""We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

""'Jihadi John' is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

""The fact that 'Jihadi John' has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

""This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

""British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide-bombers, hostage-takers, and executioners."""
1491,"It may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day, but if you see any news stories claiming Earth is headed for ""Six Days of Total Darkness"" then don't start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet.

""Satirical news site"" Huzlers.com has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week, taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they're going to be up to during the six days of darkness.

The story on the vaguely official looking website titled ""Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!"" claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame, causing ""dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90% sunlight"".

This is false. Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena (they occur due to fluctuations in Sun's magnetic field) they're not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt.

Instead they create very minor disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere. Historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today, but they're mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course — not blot out Sun.

However, the hoax story even drafts in some credible-sounding sources including Nasa chief Charles Bolden, who reportedly warned the public to stay calm. Some users even linked to a (real) video of Bolden talking about ""emergency preparedness"" — an official-sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked 'PANIC' in the brain.


This photo taken near Karasjok in Norway at around 10am local time, on January 1, 1996, shows a dark morning. This happens because of the ""polar night"" effect during winters, with the center of Sun being below the horizon. A polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. (Getty Images photo)

In actuality Bolden recorded the video to encourage US families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane — natural disasters that are a real enough threat in America.

This total-darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours (some claim that a non-existent ""photon belt"" is responsible for the blackout) and are so widespread that Nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in 2012.

1492,"Robert Plant’s publicist has described as “rubbish” a Daily Mirror report that he rejected a £500m Led Zeppelin reunion. The paper claims Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones had both signed on for the tour deal, bankrolled by Richard Branson, which would have featured John Bonham’s son Jason on drums.

Branson had proposed 35 concerts spanning just three cities, according to the Mirror. The band would fly from London to Berlin to New Jersey in a specially outfitted jet: Branson wanted to recreate The Starship, from Led Zep’s heyday, selling tickets for the plane’s back rows at £100,000 per seat.

“Branson tried to pull out all of the stops,” claimed the Mirror’s source, who claimed it was enough to convince Page, Jones, and Bonham to reprise their 2007 Celebration Day show, and that the band was even considering a further 45-night tour across five more venues. “But even [Branson’s] money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said. “[He] asked for 48 hours to think about it,” then ripped up the contract in front of a group of promoters. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

Rumours were rife earlier this year that Zeppelin would be reforming, and Page seemed newly furious at his former bandmate. “Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band,” Page said. “[Robert]’s just playing games, and I’m fed up with it, to be honest with you.”

At the end of September, Page said a reunion was no longer “a possibility or on the cards”. He told journalists at an event to promote the reissues of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy: “I’m not going to give a detail-by-detail account of what one person says or another person says, so there’s not much more I can say about that.” The guitarist explained that he is instead planning to revisit Led Zeppelin material on a 2015 solo tour.

The graphic footage was then shared hundreds of times around the country and even ended up on a pornographic website.

Miss Sandoval has allegedly faced previous disciplinary hearings at the school in Santiago del Estro over inappropriate relationships with pupils, but nothing was done due to lack of evidence.

One big problem is that the buzz is kind of pointless since the country crooner isn’t dead at all. Sure, he may be 81-years-old, but he’s still alive and truckin’ and touring, so Willie Nelson isn’t dead — he’s simply the victim of another celebrity death hoax.

The website MSMBC posted the article that Willie Nelson was “found dead today in his Maui home.” It goes on to give details to state that rumors of his death first circulated early on February 21 by social media outlets, and that the police later confirmed the news.

With the article was even a picture showing his face looking all solemn and the dates of his life.

The article states that a groundskeeper was doing some routine maintenance on Nelson’s property and found him dead on the front lawn. He called 911, and the police came out to the scene to reportedly find Nelson dead. There even quotes from the “police.”

“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.

Here’s the issue with all of this. Many people will see the site and think it is MSNBC when it’s really just MSMBC. The latter is not a real news site by any stretch of the imagination.

There are other fake story links on the side of the article, but they all lead back to the article about Willie Nelson’s so-called death. At the bottom of the page are links to their “About,” “Terms of Use,” and “Privacy,” but they all lead nowhere.

Even with more quotes from the police in the article, don’t believe that Willie Nelson is dead, because he isn’t.

“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”

The article is sadly making the rounds on Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media without having any real merit. It states that the “story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.”

Of course, it is and it hasn’t. That’s because it isn’t even remotely true.

The Missoulian just reported a day ago that Willie Nelson is going to play Ogren Park in the middle of June with Alison Kraus. Sure, anything is possible to happen, but the death of Willie Nelson right now isn’t one of them.

Willie Nelson is not dead. He is the victim of the newest celebrity death hoax going around, one that people are going to believe because it’s being shared by a ton of people.

NBC’s most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadn’t traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire.
“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” an NBC source said. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”
On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft.

Brokaw, 74, was still the “Nightly News” anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition — and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk.
“Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,” the source said.
NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale.
Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his “Nightly News” broadcast Thursday evening — and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didn’t address the issue during the broadcast.
“He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,” a network source said.
Many of Williams’ colleagues believe his claim that he simply “conflated” two versions of what happened in 2003.
“There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously,” the NBC source said.
“But we believe that Brian’s apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events.”
NBC brass hasn’t been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said.
“NBC bosses don’t understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it,” the source said.
One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a “real pompous piece of s–t.”
“He’s an a–hole,” he fumed. “He’s not a journalist. He’s a reader.
“Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside,” he said. “It’s embarrassing. He’s the face on NBC. He’s a liar.

The university has received national media attention since a student from Elon reported that the school is dropping the word freshman and replacing it with first year. The story, originally published on The College Fix, found its way to FOX News and The National Review Online, where the word “drop” changed to “ban.”

The university uses first-year in its admissions process because the types of students coming into college are not all traditional students who have graduated from high school.

“At almost every college, admissions is moving to this term because it encompasses traditional students and also includes transfers, spring admits, gap semester students, part-time students and non-traditional age students,” Anderson said. “It describes people spending their first year at Elon.”

Anderson explained that the term isn’t Elon’s alone. Duke University, the University of North Carolina system and High Point all use first-year on their admissions websites. They all refer to “The First Year Experience.” The U.S. News and World Report publishes rankings for the schools with the best first-year experience programming.

While there is no official policy on the word, first-year Blair Foreman said her orientation leader always called the group just that, and most of her professors use the term as well. She understands why the university would use it in place of freshman, but is not offended by the word.

“I get the intentions behind it,” Foreman said. “Everyone is on the same totem pole, but I don’t mind either way.”

Sophomore Tyson Glover spent his first semester at Elon in the GAP program and said he enjoyed being called  first-year rather than freshman. He said it made his transition into college easier.

“Coming into Elon January was different,” Glover said. “There’s not a lot going on. First year is an all-encompassing term, and made our transition smoother. It helped us get in the same boat as the rest of our class.”

According to the original article, Leigh-Anne Royster, director of the Inclusive Community Well-Being, said the term “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence. Anderson said Royster was answering generally why people might not like to use the term “freshman,” not referring to why Elon University does not use the term.

Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, corroborated Royster’s comments in the article.

“The student asked what the primary reason was for changing freshman to first year, presuming there was a change,” Anderson said. Zaiser explained that in general, some consider it a sexist term and that it is not a completely accurate description of the incoming classes.

There are some students who prefer freshman to first year, though. Firs- years Mackenzie Franklin and Daniel Maclaury prefer the word freshman, saying it is a more traditional term and more natural for them.

“First year makes it seem like I won’t graduate in four years,” Franklin said. “But I do use them interchangeably.”

1509,"Activists in Al Raqqa have posted images online purporting to show a U.S. Predator drone orbiting the skies of the north-east Syrian city, the chosen “capital” of the Islamic State militant group.

The 16-member activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently provided the images to various online publications. Their handheld imagery corresponds with a video uploaded to Youtube on Sept. 6.

In recent months, RIBSS has provided most of the documentation coming out of the conflict-ridden city, as almost no local or foreign journalists are present—due, of course, to Islamic State’s suppression and murder of journalists.

Last year, rebel groups overran government forces in Al Raqqa. Within several months, Islamists came to dominate the city, with Islamic State eventually coming out on top. Last month, the group took over the entire province when it pushed the remaining government forces out of one last military base.

Islamic State’s territorial gains in Syria and Iraq continue to put considerable pressure on the United States to do more than send advisers to Iraq.

In August, U.S. president Barack Obama authorized air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq. U.S. Central Command has launched 131 air strikes across the country—most around Irbil and the Mosul Dam.

The appearance of Predator in Syrian skies could indicate U.S. planning for possible air strikes in Syria, as well.

American planes and drones are flying around 60 surveillance flights evvery day over Islamic State territory, according to Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby."
1513,"A few years ago it may have seemed rather impossible for the relationship between Apple and Samsung to improve, but 2014 was and continues to be a year full of surprises. After Apple and Samsung withdrew all patent infringement lawsuits (except for those in the US) earlier this summer, the collaboration between the two tech giants seemed to have grown healthier.

Now, industry sources suggest that this partnership will tighten even further, as Samsung is expected to supply more components for the Cupertino-based giant, for both the iPhone 6 as well as the Apple Watch.

iPhone 6 and Even Apple Watch To Feature Samsung Components (Rumor)

iPhone 6 and Apple Watch to feature Samsung-made Components

A fresh report from Korea suggests that iPhone 6 units which will be manufactured in the future will make use of batteries manufactured by Samsung SDI. In addition, sources also consider the possibility that Apple will reach out to Samsung in order to employ the Korean tech giant’s NAND flash.

Apparently, Apple’s initial plans were to use Samsung’s NAND flash for the iPhone 6, but because the two companies have failed to agree on the prices, Apple has decided to use Toshiba’s TLC NAND flash in the 128 GB iPhone 6, and various other components manufactured by SK Hynix, Toshiba and SanDisk on the 64 GB variant. However, since the TLC NAND flash on the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 and 6 Plus proved to cause headaches, sources say that Apple might strike a deal with Samsung in order to supply both the NAND flash and the DRAM of future-to-be-manufactured iPhone 6 units. In addition, some industry insiders speculate that both companies are currently jointly developing communications chips for the next-gen iPhone.



 
As for the Apple Watch, the same report suggests that Apple already discussed with Samsung in regards to the supply of application processors for the wearable device, which is set to hit the market in early 2015.

It looks like the emerging Chinese smartphone manufacturers have become powerful enough to persuade both Apple and Samsung to put some of their differences aside for the(ir) greater good. These are odd times we live in, no doubt."
1515,"Washington Free Beacon senior editor Bill Gertz appeared on WMAL radio in Washington, D.C., Wednesday morning to discuss his exclusive story on 11 missing airliners from the Tripoli airport.

“(U.S. Intelligence is) concerned they could be utilized in a 9/11-style attack,” Gertz said of the planes. “If they don’t use them in suicide attacks, they could also be used to transport some of these Islamist groups to expand their reach.”

“It seems like the State Department, the Obama administration, is trying to play down these reports, but the people I talked to were fairly concerned about them,” Gertz said. “Again, they are trying to locate these jets. I don’t think the CIA has a full handle on where all of the aircraft from the airlines were. There are a number of airports in the region that are within close distance to Tripoli International, so they’re obviously looking at these places and trying to get a count of how many aircraft are there.”

When co-host Brian Wilson asked specifics with regard to how Gertz’s sources responded to the reports of the missing jets by saying the “can’t confirm” the reports, Gertz explained that “can’t confirm” in this context was not meant as a denial, but “they’re trying to play down by saying ‘well, we can’t confirm them.’ That’s kind of bureaucrat speak within the United States government.”

“You have to understand the politics of Libya right now,” Gertz said.”You have a congressional inquiry spinning up to look at the 2012 terrorist attack at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi. So that would be my only speculation as to why they’re playing it down.”"
1517,"A Macedonian man sliced off his own dick and and threw it away after his girlfriend broke up with him, citing dissatisfying sex. The man believed his small penis was to blame for the failed relationship, reports every site in the tabloidosphere.

Oliver Ilic, 22, reportedly removed the organ with one slice of a razor blade. Unable to stop the bleeding, he was forced to contact medics, who rushed him to a hospital in Kocani as blood began to soak through his jeans.

They found his dick and the razor blade in a trashcan at his house.

Although hopes for reattachment initially didn't look good–some sites reported yesterday that the hospital didn't have any doctors qualified to perform the surgery—Ilic was transferred to a different facility in Skopje, where he was surgically reunited with his poor little cock.

It's too early to tell if he'll regain full function—such as it was—in the organ.

Ilic's isn't the most tragic case of self-mutilation in Macedonia this year. According to European tabloid lore, a 40-year-old man recently cut off his penis, too, but reattachment was impossible: He had flushed it down the toilet.

1518,"Here’s an important heads-up: If you keep documents in your iCloud Drive, don’t use iOS 8’s “Reset All Settings” option. It could delete files stored in the cloud.

The bug was discovered by MacRumors, who found that selecting the “Reset All Settings” option from Settings in iOS 8 will erase iWork-related files in iCloud Drive.

This is not the way it’s supposed to work. When you reset an iPhone or iPad’s settings, iOS will even tell you that no data or media will be deleted. But in iOS 8, this isn’t working as intended.

The good news is if you don’t use iWork, you don’t have anything to fear: The deleted files bug seems to be specific to iWork documents. But you should still probably stay clear of the “Reset All Settings” option until Apple gets this sorted out. Better safe than sorry.

1519,"First, there was #BendGate. Reports flooded the media that claimed the iPhone 6 Plus was susceptible to bending when kept in your pocket.

Now, there's #HairGate. A 9to5Mac community post reveals that iPhone 6 customers are complaining on social media that their new phones keep ripping out chunks of their hair when they hold the phone up to their ear to take a call.

Twitter users claim that the seam between the glass screen and aluminium back of the iPhone 6 is to blame, and it's that gap that their hair is getting caught in.

This news follows #GapGate, which focused on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Customers complained to Samsung that their new Android phones had a gap between the screen and the case. It's unknown whether Samsung customers are also experiencing hair-loss when taking calls on their phones, as some iPhone 6 users are now reporting."

Hoax Alert: Father O’Neal, Who Has Met God and Thinks She’s a Woman, Is Made Up (Just Like God Herself)
February 22, 2015 by Terry Firma 84 Comments
Not that I’m impossible to fool, but this is certainly a bit rich (all typos and grammatical errors in the original):
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

That story, in various iterations, has been popping up in my news feed all day. Even apart from the matter of God’s gender, on which I offer no thoughts, and the matter of religious near-death experiences, which I addressed here, there’s no truth to the article. It is a hoax, a falsehood that was (probably) designed to attract cheap clicks. There is no 71-year-old Father John Michael O’Neal in Massachusetts whose heart failure required hospitalization, and who met God during a 48-minute detour through heaven.
If you go to Shutterstock and search for “old man in hospital bed,” this photo is among the top results:

You can find the same image on stock-photo sites like Dreamstime and Photolia.
As best I can tell, the story originated with World News Daily Report in early February. The publication claims to be an “American Jewish Zionist newspaper in Tel Aviv,” and unleashes on the world such fine fare as “California Man Gets 25-Pound Penile Implant to Become Pornstar,” “World Famous Taj Mahal to Be Turned into 5-Star Hotel,” and “Hollywood’s Most Famous ‘Butt Double’ Found Dead in Motel Room.” Perhaps it’s supposed to be satire.
Since then, the tale of “Father O’Neal” was initially picked up mostly by African news media with low news standards, such as Nigeria Tell, Spy Ghana, and Uganda’s Sunday Monitor (whose motto is “Truth Everyday”). From there, it migrated and multiplied to lots of other (perhaps accidental) bullshit peddlers, from India Today to KVIL, a CBS Radio affiliate in Texas.
This weekend, it’s been all over Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
I would’ve thought that religious life contains enough real absurdities to quash the need to make up additional ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
P.S.: Feast your eyes on one of the most fatuous nonpologies ever. After she was informed that her post about Father O’Neal is based on a lie, Catholic blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote:
According to a recent media update, this story is false, but I believe if it hasn’t yet happened, it truly will! Someone once said: “all stories are true some actually happened.”
Because, you know, fuck the facts."
1522,"(IraqiNews.com) Thousands of social media users are distributing an unverified photo which claims to show the body of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he was purportedly killed by US air strikes after three senior members of ISIS, including an aide to al-Baghdadi were also killed by US air strikes. The death of the three senior members and aide to al-Baghdadi were confirmed by a senior Iraqi security official when interviewed by NBC News on Thursday.

The strike on the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an aide to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as well as an explosives operative and the military leader of nearby Tal Afar, the source said on condition of anonymity. Al Arabiya cited the Iraqi Defense Ministry saying Baghdadi’s aide had been killed.

Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.” The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes across north Iraq after the brutal terrorists of ISIS gained ground in a murderous sweep in June.

A number of news outlets and websites have published the unverified photo and news about the death of al-Baghdadi by US airstrikes. IraqiNews.com has been unable to verify the photo and claim that al-Baghdadi was killed."
1523,"""I just wanted some chicken wings.""

After getting dumped by her boyfriend, a woman in China realized that only one person could help her in her time of need: Colonel Sanders.

Tan Shen, 26, accidentally on-purpose spent a full week at a 24/7 KFC in Chengdu, calling in sick to work, to mourn the loss of her relationship.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings,” Tan told Yahoo. “But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.”

But is KFC really where you’d want to spend your time of mourning? Are the chicken wings really that good?

After all, Tan herself admits that after a week, “I was getting sick of the taste of chicken, so there was no point in staying there anymore.” (That and local media started showing up to take photos).

Here are some places that might have been better week-long hideaways:

McDonald’s Find a Play Place and start enjoying the little things in life again.

Walmart If it’s good enough for a 9-month pregnant woman, as depicted in Where The Heart Is, it should be good enough for the lovesick.

Anthropologie Just so aesthetically pleasing.

A make-your-own, pay-by-the-pound Fro-Yo shop Because… cliches.

Maybe then Tan would have looked slightly more upbeat:

1524,"Research released yesterday claims that the Apple Watch will ”ignite the global smartwatch market” this year. Research firm Strategy Analytics predicts that Apple Inc. will sell more than 15 million Apple Watches worldwide in 2015 to claim 55 percent of the global smartwatch market share –a share that will instantly make Apple the number one smartwatch vendor for 2015.

Strategy Analytics forecasts that global smartwatch shipments will increase by more than 500 percent from the 4.6 million units shipped in 2014 to 28.1 million units in 2015. With the Apple Watch accounting for 15.4 million units, the remaining 12.7 million units forecast for 2015 will be made up by all other smartwatch manufacturers.

“The Apple Watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston. “Apple’s famous brand, loyal fan base, deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its Watch.”

Late last week Apple announced a special “Spring Forward” event scheduled to take place on Monday and expected to focus primarily on the upcoming Apple Watch. Apple will likely share details about the wearable that have so far been the focus of a barrage of rumors, including expected retail pricing, expected battery life and accessories. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently revealed that development of the wearable is right on track and that the Apple Watch will go on sale in April.

Strategy Analytics’ forecast  coincided with the last day of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where a range of new smartwatches were revealed over the course of the four-day event, including the Huawei Watch, two variations of LG’s Watch Urbane and the new Pebble Time.

While its forecast for Apple Watch’s initial sales is encouraging, Strategy Analytics warns that Apple may have a fight on its hands come 2016.

“Apple’s first-generation Watch is not yet perfect,” Mawston said. “For example, Apple’s Watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the Huawei Watch, battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to, and Apple’s premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers. Apple will need to upgrade tangibly its second-generation Watch to stay ahead of competitors later this year.”

Earlier this month reports surfaced claiming that Apple had placed a production order of 5 million units of the Apple Watch for the first quarter of sales and CSS Insight forecast that Apple could sell as many as 20 million smartwatches in its first year.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is also optimistic about the Apple Watch’s chances, saying it [Apple Watch] will sell millions from the start."

The famous Batmobile was spotted cruising Detroit as filming continues of Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice.

Reports began to surface online that the iconic vehicle had gone missing, presumed pinched from the Warner Brother's set two weeks ago.

But according to the Detroit Free Press, there had been no such crime.

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said the force had spoken with the producers of the movie to confirm all was well.

'The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,' Sgt Woody told the newspaper.

1529,"Rumors have hit social media that the Batmobile has been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set in Detroit. While on the face of it the idea that someone could actually make off with a Batmobile from the heavily-secured set seem somewhat ludicrous, the local Michigan media seems to be taking the reports seriously enough that the police department has been contacted to look into it.

CBS Detroit notes in their report, “Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?” WWJ950 tweets, “Was The Batmobile Stolen In #Detroit? Unconfirmed Rumors Are Swirling, And Police Tell WWJ They'll Look Into It.”

Of course, it’s a little unclear from the tweet if the police department is actually looking into the disappearance of the Batmobile or is just looking into the source of the unconfirmed rumors. Most sites seem to be pointing to Bleeding Cool as the source of the rumors, which they report as having heard from sources in Detroit.

Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on March 25, 2016."

1531,"The frightening story about a spider that reportedly burrowed through an Australian man’s surgery scar and left a disturbing red trail up his stomach, might not be a completely accurate account, according to some arachnid experts.

The stomach selfie of 21-year-old Dylan Thomas has gone viral around the globe after doctors at Bali International Medical Center apparently figured out his “mystery condition” was caused by a spider living under his skin for three days.

“Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that’s been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,” he wrote on Facebook. “Haven’t felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it’s all over.”

But the whole thing could have been caused by a different organism or be a complete fake, according to some.

“I think this is extremely suspect, unusual and likely not possible,” Christopher Buddle, associate professor at McGill University’s Department of Natural Resource Sciences, told io9. “Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might ‘crawl beneath skin through a scar’. The claim that it was ‘feeding and moving up through the scar tissue’ defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the ‘evidence’ (the spider itself) is not presented.”

Another scientist expressed skepticism over the situation as well.

[I]n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that,” Dr. Charles Griswold, Schlinger Curator of Arachnology (Emeritus) at the California Academy of Sciences, told io9.

While another organism — perhaps a tick or mite — could “‘possibly’ be ‘associated’ with something like this,” Buddle said, according to io9, it at least was “certainly not a spider.”

Thomas did not immediately respond to request for comment from TheBlaze."

By now, you’ve probably heard about #hairgate, which has people chattering about an unintended problem with the iPhone 6. According to a forum post on 9to5Mac, Apple’s latest phone traps hair in the seam between the glass and aluminum. “When you try to free it out, it hurts,” the poster laments.

Sounds like a pain, but aside from some tweets, is there any real evidence of the iPhone ripping out hair? That depends on who you ask. As Mashable demonstrates in a video, it just doesn’t seem to be happening. A variety of men and women — some with short hair, others with long hair — tested the new iPhone by taking calls, rubbing the device on their beards, “combing” their curls with it. Not a one experienced pulling or snagging. Meanwhile, enterprising YouTubers are uploading videos that demonstrate exactly the opposite effect. (#Hairgate truthers, perhaps?)
All of it adds up to a lot of outrage, with #hairgate getting thousands of tweets as well as a Today segment. It’s true that when you drop a few hundred on a new gadget, you’d like to think it won’t gobble up your hair. Considering the severity of this alleged injury, though, we can’t help but think of another hashtag: #firstworldproblems."
1534,"HBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV one of the launch partners for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with their plans.

When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to “HBO Now” directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about the that consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.

With “HBO Now,” HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for HBO such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.

HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest chink yet in the so-called cable bundle, where consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscribers as users opt of cable and opt-in to HBO Now.

But some cable providers, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling “HBO Now” with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.

Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the last several years negotiating for the rights to offer their own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.

While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive timeframe for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back-end along with a new front-end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last fall's debut of ""Game of Thrones.""

The launch of “HBO Now” will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos like Verizon and AT&T.

Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those that subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.

At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.

HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. It has been met with some resistance from current distributors, such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.

But HBO heard the same misgivings from cable when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99 cent single, more than a decade ago.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay-TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax its highest number of new subscribers -- 2.8 million -- in 30 years.

Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s TV subscribers to access it on the web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.

A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit… and is presumed stolen.
If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? It’s not like it’s a 2008 Sebring that you could mix up with just about any other Sebring. No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
If I see the Batmobile driving around anywhere I am taking photos. Even funnier: Could you imagine getting pulled over for going too slow in this car? No way right?
How would the cops catch it with all the Bat devices that come standard? Does Alfred come to your rescue? Is the Batcave set in the GPS? If so you would be safe from the cops, I presume…

1539,"TORONTO – A Canadian soldier was shot at the War Memorial in Ottawa Wednesday morning, and multiple shots were fired inside Parliament Hill.

According to a witness, the shooter had black hair, was wearing a grey jacket and a scarf.

Witnesses reported gunfire inside the halls of Parliament, including a dozen shots outside the Parliament Hill library.

Police and ambulance are on the scene, and Parliament Hill is in lockdown.


Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. with a report of shots fired.

Witnesses on the scene at the War Memorial said they were in shock; a number of them performed CPR on the victim.

“I’m just trying to grasp it now,” said a male witness, who said soldiers were doing their “normal drill.”

“They were doing their march with their rifle in their hand and he [the suspect] came out on the right hand side here and fired a shot right at one of the soldiers. [The soldier] went down and the other went to his aid. The suspect took off across the street into a vehicle,” he said.

1540,"Nigeria has agreed a truce with militant Islamist group Boko Haram, who look set to the release schoolgirls it abducted earlier this year

The Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped earlier this year by Islamist militant group Boko Haram look set to be released following a ceasefire agreement with the Nigerian military.

This truce, for which direct negotiations had been held in neighbouring Chad, marks the end of a five-year conflict between the Nigerian government and the Islamist insurgents.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” chief of defence staff Alex Badeh announced at the end of a three day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon.

It appears as though the 219 school girls that are being held captive by Boko Haram will be released, although a Defence Ministry spokesman said that part of the negotiations still needs to be finalised.

He was “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC: ""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them. I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at a meeting next week in Chad.

On April 15, Boko Haram – which means ‘education is sinful' – raided a school in the remote north-eastern town of Chibok, kidnapping 276 school girls and women. Dozens escaped in the days after the abduction.

This act brought the group international notoriety, with world leaders condemning the kidnapping and internet activists launching the global social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls.

Boko Haram had demanded the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls, but Nigeria president Goodluck Jonathan would not swap prisoners.

President Jonathan has come under fire in his country for failing to handle the threat of Boko Haram, which has reportedly killed 13,000 civilians in the years since 2009.

After insurgent success, Boko Haram began seizing and holding territory in the northeast of Nigeria, declaring a caliphate similar to that of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

In recent weeks, however, the Nigerian military has taken back towns from the extremists and is thought to have killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants.

Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government’s spokesman on the kidnappings, said: ""Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire.”

""Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,"" a security source told Reuters.

That source said, however, that it is unlikely that the ceasefire extends to all factions of the Boko Haram group.

""There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,"" the source said.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, the presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria had for months been neglected by the western media following the emergence of Isis in the Middle East and more recently the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.

But, on Monday, major British politicians signed a letter that called for action against Boko Haram, and for the rescue of their captives.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Ashdown classed Boko Haram alongside Isis as a part of a “growing, well-organised international terror network that poses a direct threat to UK national security.”

Animals treated at Toll Barn vets', North Walsham

Photo gallery

Vet Faye Bethell used tiny instruments to remove one lump close to the fish’s anus, and another from its dorsal fin.

The fish-lover had taken the sick, three-inch pet for a consultation at North Walsham’s Toll Barn Veterinary Centre, according to Miss Bethell, 29.

At first he had baulked at the price quoted for the treatment and went away. But he had returned five minutes later and asked for it to go ahead.

Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years. The ailing fish, which has made a full recovery, was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.

Fishy facts
■ Goldfish, which can be bought for less than £3 each, can live up to 10 years.

■ Goldfish have a memory-span of at least three months.

■ Goldfish can grow more than a foot long, but can be stunted by being kept in tanks too small for them and where the water quality is poor.

■ Goldfish have no eyelids, so they have to sleep with their eyes open.

■ Goldfish have been kept as pets for more than 2,000 years.

■ The collective noun for goldfish is a “glint” or a “troubling”.

The delicate procedure, which lasted about 50 minutes, involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish’s water.

As it lost its balance, it was removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape. The anaesthetic water was then introduced into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills, through which it breathes.

Using a miniature heart-rate monitor, Miss Bethell checked that the fish was properly “under” before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.

She then sewed each cut with three stitches, finally using a special “glue” to cover and waterproof the fish’s scales before it was gradually re-awakened.

Working with some weird and wonderful creatures
Taking lumps off goldfish is all in a day’s work for vet Faye Bethell, who spent one morning this week castrating a skunk.

Cadbury, the chocolate skunk, had been brought in for the snip by his Scratby Garden Centre owners.

Since opening Toll Barn vets’ a year ago, specialising in exotics, Miss Bethell has performed a varied range of operations. They include:

■ removing a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake, which weighed just 12g;

■ taking out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care;

■ treating sugar gliders (a gliding possum) for a poor diet, and a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes;

■ removing an air-rifle pellet from a Mundesley cat, discovered lodged under its skin during its routine booster jab check;

■ working with wildlife rescue groups to save an injured sparrowhawk. Miss Bethell pinned its broken wing. It has since been successfully released into the wild;

■ spending Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob, which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its owner’s pills.

“There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets – but that was an expensive little goldfish,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Tuesday morning castrating Cadbury the skunk.

The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals, as well as the more usual pets.

The past 12 months have also seen Miss Bethell remove a skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake which weighed just 12g.

She has successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig, at a cost of about £600, including post-op care.

Sugar gliders (a gliding possum) have been treated for a poor diet, a degu (a large rat-like rodent) for diabetes and a cat from Mundesley, which was being examined as part of its annual booster jab check, was discovered to have been shot by an air-gun pellet, which she operated to remove.

She also recently helped wildlife rescue groups save an injured sparrow hawk by pinning a broken wing, so that it could recover and be released.

“It’s been an absolutely brilliant year with lovely clients and lovely animals,” said Miss Bethell, who spent Boxing Day operating to remove a corn on the cob which had got trapped in a dog’s intestines, as well as making a puppy vomit after it had eaten its mistress’ pills.

“It’s exceeded my expectations,” she added.

“I can’t believe the variety we have had.”"
1542,"Apple Watch will take approximately two hours to fully charge and deliver all-day battery life with normal on-and-off usage, according to TechCrunch. Those estimates corroborate a previous report that also claimed the Apple Watch will deliver all-day battery life and support up to five hours of heavy usage per charge.

The report also claims that the Apple Watch will only deliver notifications while worn on the wrist. The smartwatch will not ping you for notifications without being in contact with skin so that the device is not disruptive at unnecessary times. Apple Watch will also stop delivering notifications when the battery reaches 10% or lower in an effort to conserve the remaining power.""Here’s a tidbit you might not know — in order to receive notifications from apps, the Watch must be on your wrist and locked. They require contact with your skin. There will be no in-app dropdown notifications or constant pinging while it’s off your wrist. Push notifications also cease when the battery reaches 10 percent. Those decisions speak to the care with which Apple is handling notifications.""Apple continues to tweak Digital Crown on the Apple Watch, giving the button a ""weightier, higher-end feel."" Pressing and holding down the Digital Crown activates Siri, which the report claims works well and can be used for labeling, directions and commands using a paired iPhone. The goal of the Apple Watch, the report describes, is to return some of your attention away from your smartphone by allowing you to communicate from your wrist on the go.

While both reports this afternoon have provided a closer look at the Apple Watch, there are still several question marks surrounding the wrist-worn device. That will change in less than three days, when Apple provides more details about the Apple Watch at its highly-anticipated ""Spring Forward"" media event in San Francisco. The keynote begins on Monday at 10 AM Pacific and MacRumors will be providing live coverage of the event.

1543,"Editors are said to be ""petrified"" of rats spotted under - and on top of desks at the fashion magazine's new offices

Last time we checked, rats weren't chic - so why they're hanging around Vogue's new NYC offices is anyone's guess.

Publishing house Condé Nast have just moved into a new home at 1 WTC - the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere - and there's a nasty problem occurring, according to Page Six.

The reported rodent situation - which was first reported by People back in November - isn't going away. But according to Page Six, Vogue boss Anna Wintour is determined to ignore it.

Getty   Here's Anna, definitely not thinking about rats

A source told Page Six that editors noticed a rat on the loose in the office - so they informed their notoriously frosty fashion boss, as you would.

""They were petrified, and told Anna, 'We found rats under our desk,'"" an insider told Page Six. One said, 'There’s a rat on top of my desk.'""

But Wintour allegedly told the staff: ""I don’t want to hear about it.""

A different source also told Page Six that the rat problem is ongoing.

However, another Vogue source denies that there's a rodent presence in the Vogue offices, telling Page Six: ""That conversation never happened.""

Back in November a source told People: ""The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It's nasty.""

Well, Maybe Anna Wintour just really loves cheese, or something."
1544,"The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating an incident of a dog abandoned at a train station along with a suitcase.

The SPCA says the dog was found Jan. 2 tied to a railing at the Ayr railway station in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The suitcase was filled with possessions, including a pillow, a toy, food bowl, and food, according to the SPCA.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said the dog's name is Kai.

Officials said the male shar-pei crossbreed, who is 2 or 3 years old, had a microchip and they were able to track down the last registered owner.

""Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him. This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about,"" according to the SPCA website.

The SPCA says the society will look after him until a suitable owner is found.

In the country, abandoning an animal violates the Animal Health and Welfare Act of 2006. The SPCA says, ""Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.""

1545,"Macaulay Culkin has once again died — at least, according to a death hoax spreading online.

The troubled actor, who at one point was reportedly entrenched in heroin addiction that friends feared he had only months to live, is once again the subject of a hoax claiming that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment.

News that Macaulay Culkin had allegedly died spread quickly on Facebook and Twitter, with users linking to a story on something called MSNBC.website.com (which is entirely separate from the real MSNBC). The report read:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

It has been only a few months since the last hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead. The actor was also reported dead back in April, with Facebook users mourning his alleged death and even a memorial page popping up.

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (April 20, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away,” the report claimed. “Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”

Though reps for the actor denied the April reports, they have not yet spoken out on the latest hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead."
1547,"A picture of a letter to parents from a box of Lego in the 1970s is going viral after being uploaded to Reddit.

To Parents.

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The image was uploaded by Reddit user fryd_ on Saturday morning. He spoke to BuzzFeed News about it:

I came across the pamphlet whilst playing Lego with my niece & nephew at their Grandma’s house and it struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago. I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!

Lego famously had egalitarian advertising in the 1970s and 1980s, this poster is from 1981.

Sounds like a familiar message…

BuzzFeed has reached out to Lego for a comment on the letter."
1549,"Boston - So lately, tongues have been wagging due to a recent story of an elderly priest who died and had a conversation with God, and a female God at that.
The story has been dancing around on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.
It's also sallied across the seas and made it into the African media and the Indian media.
The story even made it's way to that holy land of obnoxious religious redneckery known as Texas.
The story goes something like this:
An old fart, er, I mean Catholic priest, in Massachusetts was officially dead for over 48 minutes before medical staff ""miraculously"" re-started his heart, World News Daily Report says. All the while, Father John Micheal O'Neal says he went to heaven and met God, who was all motherly and feminine and just happened to be a woman.
Father O'Neal, 71, was rushed to the hospital in late January after being hit with a major heart attack, but was declared dead shortly after his arrival. He was brought back to life via some sort of newfangled mechanical gadgetry and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital, used more newfangled mechanical gadgetry to unclog vital arteries to his brain. Soon they returned his heart to a normal rhythm. Father O'Neal woke up less than 48 hours later and recovered perfectly, World News Daily Report says.
Well, of course. I mean, after all, if you're going to have a story about some elderly dude talking to God, you can't really have him die, can you? That wouldn't come out in the wash.
There was much wringing of hands, and Catholic Blogger Bridget Mary Meehan wrote:
""The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors. Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O'Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the 'Holy Mother.'""
Then she wonders:
""Why is Cardinal O'Malley and the Boston Archdiocese so upset? You would think he'd be inspired. Perhaps, he is afraid that if God is a woman, then, that could put a big crack in the church's stained glass ceiling and open the door to women priests!""
Sure, why not employ more delusional people? They're certainly entertaining.
But why is the good Archbishop bothered?
Perhaps because Father John Micheal O'Neal doesn't exist. You see, he's really a nice old man on Shutterstock, who probably wishes he were somewhere else other than the hospital.
Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley says the story is a hoax.
""We do not have a priest of this name,"" he told Metro.co.uk. ""I believe this could be a hoax story.""
And despite whatever Meehan thinks, it's never been verified that O'Malley ever issued a public disavowal of the priest's alleged statements. It's just not in the public records, About.com reports.
Perhaps, as this story runs its course, the media will realize it was asleep when it should have been awake.
You see, World News Daily, makes no bones about the fact that it's a satire site. Here's the site's disclaimer:
""WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.""
When Meehan was apprised of the fact that the story was a hoax, she offered up this fantasyland reply:
""According to a recent media update, this story is false, but I believe if it hasn't yet happened, it truly will! Someone once said: 'All stories are true some actually happened.'""
I'm not making this up.

1551,"We’ve all had that feeling of being jilted by our lover and many reach for the wine or chocolate.

But one dumped woman decided that she was going to gorge on chicken wings and set up camp in KFC for an entire week.

Tan Shen, 26, said that she was walking around depressed after being dropped by her lover and went into a branch of the fast food outlet in a train station in Chengdu, China.

She said: ‘I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

‘I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.’

Staff eventually realised after three days that she had not left the store and she told them that she just needed time to think while ordering another box of chicken wings and extra large fries.

They let her stay there but then when local media started to arrive to question her, she decided to leave the city and move in with her parents.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: ‘I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.’

1554,"A Muslim convert shot dead a Canadian soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa today before exchanging dozens of shots with guards inside Parliament in a terrifying attack that left the nation's capital on lockdown.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial on Wednesday morning.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened fire before he was shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms.

And now, we have our first look at Zehaf-Bibeau in a photo that shows him holding a gun and wearing a keffiyeh.

Scroll down for videos

Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the Muslim convert who shot dead solider Nathan Cirillo and opened fire on Canadian Parliament

Killed: Corporal Nathan Cirillo, was shot dead by a gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa on Wednesday morning. He leaves behind a young son

Final moments: Cirillo (left) is pictured guarding the National War Memorial just minutes before he was shot

Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Quebec as Michael Joseph Hall.

A criminal court database shows a man with the same name was arrested five times while living in Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in February 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in December 2004, serving one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.

He also spent a day in jail in March of 2004 for a parole violation and was again convicted of marijuana possession in 2009, reports Global News.

In 2011, he was charged with robbery in Vancouver but served only one day in prison after he pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of uttering threats. and was credited with 66 days in pre-trial custody.

Sources told the Globe and Mail that he had been designated a 'high-risk traveler' and the government had seized his passport

His attack comes just two days after another Canadian soldier was killed in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.

Authorities initially said they believed 'two or three' gunmen were responsible for the attack in Ottawa on Wednesday, but at an afternoon press conference, Chief of Police Charles Bordeleau would not confirm whether or not they are still searching for other shooters.

'We're still in the process of clearing Parliament Hill,' he said. 'It is a slow and methodical process.'

The shooting spree began at 9.52am when witnesses reported seeing a gunman climb out of a car, grab a rifle, shoot the soldier in the abdomen and then run towards Parliament.

Corporal Cirillo was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.

Cirillo, a fitness fanatic and animal lover with a young son, was a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

Ottawa police then received a call at 9.54am that shots had been heard inside the Parliament, while journalists cowering inside said they heard dozens of rounds and could smell gunpowder in the halls.

A shootout unfolded and Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before joining the Parliament in 2006. (He is pictured by the Hill Times.)

'I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,' said Julian Fantino, Canada's Minister of Veterans Affairs, on Twitter.

The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons and providing safety and security of the Parliament buildings and the people inside.

As gunfire erupted in the hallways, journalists and politicians scrambled for safety, while members in the Conservative Party caucus room blocked the door with a stack of chairs.

A parliamentary guard was shot in the leg during the gunfight but is recovering in hospital, according to Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove, who is inside the building.

He had been scheduled to give Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, her Canadian citizenship today.

The government said there is not yet any evidence that Zehaf-Bibeau has any ties to violent Islamic extremism but noted that it is still early in the investigation.

An Ottawa Citizen reporter inside the Parliament building, Jordan Press, wrote on Twitter that a suspect was '5'9-5'10, overweight & wearing a dark jacket'.

Witnesses also told the Citizen that they saw a man wearing an 'Arabic scarf' and carrying a long rifle, while others said the suspect looked South American.

He said that the man jumped over a fence around Parliament Hill and forced someone out of their car, then drove to the front doors of the Parliament building and fired at least twice.

Reporter Jordan Press added that the car - a Toyota Corolla - was parked in front of the building with its engine still running.

A video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed RCMP officers moving through Parliament's main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

Other reporters inside the building described the panic in the hallways.

He went on: 'I was in the west wing of the building and shooter appears to have entered through main door on south side, heading north along hallway.

'I heard dozens of gunshots and the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways right now.'

He added: 'One security guard said that it appears one officer may have been shot but we have no way to confirm that.'

Speaking to CNN, Wingrove said it appeared Zehaf-Bibeau entered the front entrance that has 'many armed guards' but no metal detector'.

'If you flash your valid pass, they allow you to go in,' he said. 'This appears to be the entry point [of the gunman] based on witness accounts.'

1555,"Once again, rumors that Macaulay Culkin died have flourished online. But, once again, he's not dead.

The 34-year-old's representatives confirmed that the actor and musician is very much alive, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The flurry of RIPs on social media sites were due to an online death hoax cooked up about the child star of the Home Alone film series. Earlier this year, a similar death hoax surfaced, but it was also dismissed by Culkin's representatives at the time.

A Facebook memorial page announcing the actor's death sparked the rumors, according to fact-checking site Snopes.com. The Facebook page has since been taken down.

Culkin was photographed with his band, Pizza Underground, after the fake death news started swirling.

1559,"Macaulay Culkin is not dead, despite another fast-spreading Internet hoax indicating the Home Alone star's demise ... for the second time this year alone.

The troubled and sometimes reclusive actor, 34, who at one point was reportedly in the throes of heroin addiction and appeared gaunt, is alive and well.

Macaulay Culkin Alive!
According to the latest Macaulay Culkin death hoax, he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. Facebook and Twitter users quickly bought in.

With fans linking to a story on something called MSNBC (dot) website (dot) com - obviously not the real NBC, MSN or MSNBC - the story went viral.

According to the unconfirmed and unsubstantiated reports, Culkin was found dead after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member:

""At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.""

Det. James Patterson, allegedly of the Manhattan Police Department, said:

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened.”

The actor turned musician was also reported dead back in April, with Facebook users mourning his alleged death and even a memorial page popping up.

Though reps for the actor denied the April reports, they have not yet spoken out on the latest hoax claiming that Culkin is dead ... but he's still not.

He was seen with his band, The Pizza Underground, last night (see above).

Lil Wayne has been the subject of more than one death hoax over the years ... and more than one actual near-death experience. So it's believalble.
Culkin has become much lower profile as an adult than when he was one of the biggest child stars of all time, so it's easy to see how one would believe this.

1560,"A Macedonian man cut off his penis and threw it in a trash can after his girlfriend broke up with him due to lack of skills in the bedroom.

Oliver Ilic, 22, was told that he was no good in bed so he allegedly mutilated himself then threw the remains away, Metro reports.

The man told doctors he believes his small penis was to blame for the split. Ilic called emergency services after he could not stop the bleeding and was taken to a hospital in the east Macedonian town of Kocani.



Police searched his house and found the severed organ in a dustbin after it had been sliced off using a razor blade.

Ilic was transferred to a hospital in the capital Skopje, where surgeons were able to sew the member back after a complicated five-hour surgery, the Daily Mirror reports.

However, it was too early to know if the man’s organ would ever work properly again.

According to news.com.au, this isn’t the first time a Macedonian man has chopped off his penis.

A 40-year-old man did the same thing recently, but in his case the penis was not reattached because he flushed it down a toilet.

1562,"Mum took to the streets with a placard offering to sell her son to the highest bidder

Struggling parents tried to sell their son in a street auction to pay for life saving cancer treatment for his twin sister.

Shocking pictures show the mum of the twins standing on the streets in Qingdao, a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell her son to the highest bidder.

He was standing alongside his 29-year-old mum, Meng Xiangyan, as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

CEN   Mum Meng Xiangyan has gone onto the street to try and raise the money for her ill daughter by selling their son who is the girl's twin.

His sister is suffering from acute leukemia and, though the mum said she and husband loved both of their children, their daughter would most certainly die unless they could get urgent medical treatment.

They were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives.

“It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

CEN   Mum Meng Xiangyan has gone onto the street to try and raise the money for her ill daughter by selling their son who is the girl's twin.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out.

The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

CEN   Mum Meng Xiangyan has gone onto the street to try and raise the money for her ill daughter by selling their son who is the girl's twin.

Their plight follows on from a recent similar story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter.

'My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'

According to That's Magazines, she was also in possession of another poster that stated: 'Boss fled after industrial accident and we don't have the money for treatment. I'm willing to sell my child to save her father.'

Many locals who witnessed her in distress were sympathetic to her plight.

Although some gave her money, no-one offered to purchase her daughter in the four hours she sat in the street with the sign, the magazine reported."
1563,"Mohammed Islam, the 17-year-old whose profile has circulated across the nation, says he did not make $72 million from trading stocks.

Islam, a high school student at Stuyvesant in New York City, was profiled by the New Yorker, which claimed that he made $72 million from the market.

But Islam told CNBC that the figure is not accurate, although he declined to be more specific other than saying it’s closer to a few million dollars.

“The attention is not what we expected – we never wanted the hype. This was about friends trying to make something exciting together, ” Islam said.

“We expected a regular article about what we hope to do” in our career, he said. “The way we were portrayed is not who we are.”

The New Yorker claimed that it got the figure from rumors.

“Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,” it said in a statement. “However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.”

Islam says he would like to become a hedge fund manager, and find a mentor who is a great trader.

His inspiration is Paul Tudor Jones.

Islam, who trades mainly in Crude Oil futures and Gold futures and small to mid-cap equities, told Business Insider he’s already learned a lot.

“When I learned that I needed discipline, a strategy that had been back tested, and enough capital, I buckled down and made sure I didn’t make one more trade until I had done that,” he said.

“I traded using my plan and didn’t go astray and followed the cardinal rule of minimizing losses and maximizing profits. This made me profitable and to this day I look upon that as a major goal I accomplished.”"
1564,"At least two experts are questioning the authenticity of an audio file that is purported to have captured the gunshots that killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes and former Los Angeles police officer David Klinger both said Wednesday morning that they initially felt the recording alleged to reveal the sequence of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson was a hoax, according to Mediaite.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something that one of Howard Stern’s punk people have been doing … I don’t have a high degree of confidence in it,” Klinger said on CNN’s “New Day.” “I look at this and my first inclination is that someone is trying to punk CNN.”

He cited the fact that the clip emerged two weeks after the shooting as well as the curious words being voiced by a man in the audio as reasons why he doubted its authenticity, though he said he remains open to seeing whether an investigation finds it legitimate.

A man’s voice can be heard in the audio telling a woman, “You are pretty. You’re so fine, just going over some of your videos. How could I forget?” The context of the remarks is unclear, though purported gunshots can be heard in the background.

And Klinger wasn’t alone in his skepticism. Fuentes also said that he has qualms over the authenticity of the audio.

“When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing — it’s a hoax, but maybe not. Maybe they’ll be able to authenticate it,” he said.

Fuentes said that the FBI’s investigation will likely include engineers at Quantico examining the audio to see if there was any dubbing and to examine whether the complete tape was delivered to CNN, Mediaite reported.

Watch their comments below:

CNN “New Day” co-host Michaela Pereira noted that an attorney — a woman named Lopa Blumenthal — had delivered the audio to the network, vouching for its authenticity on behalf of her unnamed client.

The five men had been kept in a high security detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until they were set free in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl in spring 2014.

Taliban members Khairullah Khairkhwa, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammad Fazl, Abdul Haq Wasiq, and Mohammed Nabi were all freed by the Obama administration in May to secure Sgt. Bergdahl’s release.

SEE ALSO: Army denies final decision on Bowe Bergdahl has been made

Ever since the exchange was made, the 28-year-old Sgt. Bergdahl has been the poster child in a national security debate over whether the five-for-one trade qualified as negotiating with terrorists. Obama administration officials maintain that they executed a successful rescue operation while lawmakers have remained skeptical, based in part on suspicions among soldiers that Sgt. Bergdahl was actually a deserter.

Now, those tensions are resurfacing amid accusations that a U.S. intelligence program designed to intercept and monitor the five Taliban’s communications has turned up evidence that one has a penchant for terrorist activity, CNN reported.

Military officials declined to specify which of the former detainees has allegedly been making overtures toward other militants near Qatar.


 
“We do not comment on specific cases,” Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said in a statement Thursday.

Col. Warren told The Washington Times that the U.S. military leverages its intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic connections to mitigate any attempt by a former detainee to return to terrorist activity. Follow-on action is taken when necessary, he said.

“We work with the host nation – whatever nation they’re in. We work with that host nation to take legal actions, to take law enforcement actions,” he said.

Lawmakers on Thursday bristled at reports that one of the high-level militants administration officials exchanged for Sgt. Bergdahl might soon become a threat to Americans abroad.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican and a member of the Senate Armed Services committee, said she was disturbed by the news, which only served to highlight “the danger of the administration’s irresponsible decision” to free the terrorists.

She used the report to highlight her legislative battle to keep detainees who pose a serious threat to the United States and its interests locked up at the detention camp.

“With nearly 30 percent of former Guantanamo detainees suspected or confirmed of reengaging in terrorism, the administration’s continued policy of releasing dangerous terrorists endangers Americans and our allies,” she said. “Consistent with the legislation I have introduced, I renew my call for suspending transfers of detainees assessed to be high or medium risk. I look forward to the Senate Armed Services Committee considering this legislation as soon as possible.”

CNN reported that Congress had been notified of the former detainee’s activity.

The news that one of the men has rekindled an interest in terrorist activity comes just as Sgt. Bergdahl is facing potential charges of desertion."

1568,"It is one of the most annoying aspects of modern air travel - kicking off shoes and removing belts to get through security without setting off the scanner.

One frustrated traveller clearly decided the only answer was to strip off altogether, much to the surprise of security guards.

The incident at Pulkovo Airport, in St Petersburg, Russia, saw the man strip his clothes off in a nonchalant manner before strolling through the metal detector watch by bemused airport workers.

Two guards can be seen chatting and looking on as the man bends down to remove his shoes and then starts to remove his belt.

Suddenly the man, who some sources believe may be an IT department worker at the airport, takes off his trousers altogether an places them in the tray with the rest of his belongings.

One security worker can be seen nudging his colleague and pointing to the man, but neither appears to know what to do next.

At first all seems as normal as the man bends down to remove his shoes - a common request by security when passing through metal detectors at airports

Suddenly the man surprises staff by removing his trousers altogether and placing them in a tray

As startled workers look on, seemingly unsure what to do, the man continues stripping off

Unbothered by the attention, the man moves onto his top half and whips off his jumper, leaving him completely naked.

But he still takes a moment to remove the all-important wrist watch - the one thing that actually could set off the scanner - before strutting through the metal detecting arch.

Staff stand back and appear to let him just walk through the metal detectors. The cheeky man even jokingly hesitate by the workers as if to check they don't want to search him further.

Completely unbothered by the attention, the man then strolls through the security gate, even pausing by security staff as if to ask if he needs to be searched further

The first thing the man puts back on is his wrist watch as he gathers his clothing up at the end of the conveyor belt

Then, as if there is nothing unusual about the situation, the man picks up his clothes - places his wrist watch back on first, then proceeds to walk off.

St Petersburg police are said to be investigating the incident.

Passengers at airports around the world have long complained of 'invasive' searches at security points, with American passengers in particular complaining about the methods of the Transport Security Administration (TSA).

And instead of hurriedly getting changed, the man simply bundles up his clothes and walks off

It seems this gentleman isn't the first to stage a naked protest either.

The two were later sentenced for public order offences."

1570,"Famed NBC journalist Tom Brokaw thinks that Nightly News anchor Brian Williams should be fired, according to a report from the New York Post's Page Six, which cited NBC insiders. Brokaw's ire was prompted by Williams' admission that a story he has often repeated about being in a helicopter, which was shot down during the 2003 Iraq war, was untrue.

“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” the source told the paper. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”

The source also said that both Brokaw and former NBC News President Steve Capus were aware that the story was untrue ""for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it.""

Williams had repeatedly claimed that he had been traveling on a U.S. military helicopter that was downed by RPG fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, most recently on a Jan. 30 broadcast. He also told the story during an appearance on David Letterman's show.

NBC shared a clip of Williams recounting the story on Facebook, “Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft. I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened,” Lance Reynolds, the flight engineer for the helicopter that was struck, wrote in response, prompting Williams' on-air apology Thursday.

Speculation has been rife about whether Williams will, or should, lose his job or face some kind of sanction for the misrepresentation. Williams argued that it did not represent dishonesty, saying rather that he “made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago.”

Thus far, NBC News has made no official statement about the incident, and has announced no investigations or possible disciplinary measures, suggesting that the company is supporting the anchor, and hopes to ride out the wave of criticism he is currently attracting, the Washington Post reported.

“You could say it’s business as usual,” an anonymous NBC executive told the paper. “He has the whole support of NBC.”

In addition to the apparent support of NBC, Williams also has the support of his esteemed colleague Dan Rather, who defended Williams Thursday.

""I don't know the particulars about that day in Iraq. I do know Brian,"" Rather said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. ""He's a longtime friend and we have been in a number of war zones and on the same battlefields, competing but together. Brian is an honest, decent man, an excellent reporter and anchor -- and a brave one. I can attest that -- like his predecessor Tom Brokaw -- he is a superb pro, and a gutsy one."""
1572,"Multiple users of anonymous web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their internet service unless they stop using the legal software.

According to a report on Deepdotweb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ""illegal"" and told customers that using it is against the company's policies.

Tor is a type of web browser that, in theory, makes all your internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hitmen.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn't illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an ""illegal service."" One Comcast representative, identified only as Kelly, warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.

Comcast customers, speaking to Deepdotweb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to Deepdotweb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor internet traffic in case they receive a court order:

We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.

1573,"Astronomers, including experts at NASA, have questioned whether the blast and crater, reported earlier this week outside the Nicaraguan capital, were actually the product of a meteorite.

Initial reports, including information issued by the Nicaraguan government, suggested a piece of space rock broke off from a larger asteroid passing between the Earth and its moon -- creating a sizable crater, measuring roughly 40 feet across, near Managua's international airport.

But NASA officials say the lack of eyewitness accounts raises doubts about that scenario. Plus, astronomers say, the timeline doesn't work out.

""This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated,"" NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans told National Geographic. ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

Yeomans' doubts are shared by Bill Cooke, head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. Cooke says the energy needed to create such a crater would be the equivalent of a single ton of dynamite.

""For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ... despite the population,"" Cooke told Sci-Tech Today. ""So I'm very skeptical.""

Nicaraguan officials are apparently now quite confused themselves, and have asked the U.S. to help sort the whole thing out.

""Considering the small amount of experience and the lack of research means, Nicaragua desires to request the good offices of the (US) embassy to get the support of the US Geological Survey,"" the country's deputy foreign minister, Orlando Gomez, wrote in a letter to the U.S. Ambassador in Managua, Phyllis Powers.

It's not yet clear whether the U.S. will provide investigative assistance -- or what the assistance would look like.

Rogen will reportedly don the mantle of Steve Wozniak, according to Variety, in the film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle.

The film is based on Walter Isaacson’s biography on Steve, and is said to be divided into three long scenes that take place backstage before Apple product launches. Sorkin says the film will portray Jobs as part-hero, part anti-hero, leaving Rogen plenty of room to bring in some comedic relief.

Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and was the engineer behind the Apple I and Apple II computers that made Apple a household name in the 1970s. Woz left Apple in 1987, but he still pops up at Apple events and in the headlines with his commentary on the state of tech.

Rogen starred in ‘Neighbors’ earlier this year and will be in ‘The Interview’ with James Franco. Other actors haven’t been announced for the Steve Jobs film, but Scott Rudin Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady have been tapped as producers, with shooting rumored to start in Spring of 2015."

 	With three-years left on his contract, beyond this season, at an annual salary of $6 million -- his annual cap hit is $5.25 million -- Kane is an extremely valuable asset, presumably in need of a change of scenery.
After scoring 30 goals in the 2011-12 season, Kane has yet to break 20 goals. It should be noted that in the 2012-13 shortened season, due to the lockout, Kane was on pace for 29 goals.

Kane has also battled injuries, which has hindered his ability to perform on the ice.

But that's not what concerns the Jets. What concerns the Jets is his off-ice activities.

Kane was scratched from Winnipeg's last game against Vancouver, in front of his hometown family and friends. As the Winnipeg Sun reports, the decision to sit Kane out of that game has set off alarm bells, once again, for the Jets.

According to TSN Hockey Insider Bob McKenzie, the Jets and Kane may have finally hit a ""crossroads"" and the organization may have ""come to realization they need to go their separate ways.""

The Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers have expressed significant interest in Kane in the past, and both teams could renew discussions with the Jets, if GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is willing to entertain offers.

But the Jets aren't willing to move Kane without a significant return coming back their way -- presumably in the form of a top-six forward, a prospect and a draft pick.

Trade talks should pick up between now and the trade deadline, but that doesn't necessarily mean a move will be made by March 2. The Jets could wait until the off-season to explore moving Kane.

In 37 games with the Jets this season, to date, Kane has registered 10 goals and 12 assists for 22 points."
1579,"BUNBURY, Australia, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- A West Australian man who developed a mysterious mark on his skin during a trip to Bali said doctors found a tropical spider had burrowed under his skin.
Dylan Thomas said he first noticed the mark on his stomach during his trip to the Indonesian island Saturday and he visited a doctor Sunday when he noticed the wound growing and producing a burning sensation.



The doctor told Thomas he had been bitten by an insect and gave him some antihistamines.

However, Thomas said the wound continued to worsen Monday and he went to a hospital, where a dermatology specialist identified the problem.

""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,"" Thomas posted on Facebook.



The spider was dead when the doctor removed it with tweezers. Hospital staff said the spider had burrowed in through Thomas' appendix scar and crawled under his skin to the man's sternum.

Thomas said he is hoping his ordeal will inspire his friends to ship in money for him to get a giant spider tattooed across his chest in the style of Spider-Man's costume."

1582,"A Lego pamphlet from 1974, unearthed and posted on Reddit this weekend, has some advice for parents that rings true 40 years later:

True then, true now.(Reddit / fryd_)
The pamphlet’s authenticity was questioned after it went viral over the weekend, but Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbæk confirmed to Quartz that the document is real, and was included with a series of Lego dollhouses. (If the dollhouse figures look a little strange in the photo above, it’s because Lego’s iconic “minifigure” wasn’t invented until 1978.)
“The pamphlet was contained in the product line regarding Lego dollhouses, it was targeted primarily at girls age four and up,” he said in a phone interview. “To us it’s expressing what we’ve always been about, which is about encouraging creative play.”
Lego became the world’s biggest toymaker this year, due in large part to the enormous success of The LEGO Movie. But it has also drawn criticism from fans for its reliance on licensed products from the Star Wars franchise and other Hollywood properties, and it has struggled at times to appeal to girls as well as boys. One seven-year-old girl wrote a letter to the company complaining about the girl-oriented Lego Friends: “All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks.”
Trangbæk argued that Lego Friends, which is now two years old, along with the company’s many Hollywood-themed toys, all share a common DNA with classic Lego sets, including the 1974 dollhouses.
“It’s not about what type of play we’re offering, it’s all about children having the materials in their hands to create whatever they want,” he said. “When you open the box, it’s just Lego bricks.”"

That said, there is debate about the authenticity of the image. The page the drawing was shared from was initially verified by Facebook, but that verification was later removed. Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks told Animal New York that the page is ""100 per cent fake"" and the artist's website says Banksy is ""not on Facebook and has never used Twitter.""

Many have speculated, however, that the denials are all part of cultivating Banksy's puzzling persona.

The Guardian and Mashable both identified the Instagram post as being authentic, but Mashable later updated its story to reflect doubts about the image's authenticity. In 2013 The New York Times identified a different Instagram account as being linked to the artist.

1585,"Apple was light on technical specifications in announcing its forthcoming Watch earlier this month, but one analyst has checked with the company's supply chain to find component makers expect the final shipping product to include 512 megabytes of RAM, and a ""mainstream version"" with 4 gigabytes of internal storage.

The details were reported in a new research note to investors on Monday by Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. The note, which was provided to AppleInsider, claims that the 512 megabytes of mobile DRAM will likely be supplied by Samsung, Hynix and Micron.

As for the internal storage, Arcuri believes Apple may offer an 8-gigabyte version of the Watch in addition to the standard 4-gigabyte version, but he said the larger-capacity option will not likely be the default configuration. He expects the memory will come from ""most major NAND suppliers.""

As for other internal components, Arcuri said he expects the Apple Watch to feature a wireless combination chip similar to the Broadcom BCM43342 found in the iPhone 5s. Interestingly, that chip includes a GPS radio, which Arcuri admitted is ""somewhat at odds"" with Apple's announcement, where the company said the Watch will require being tethered to an iPhone in order to offer GPS data.

The analyst offered no explanation for this discrepancy, but it's possible that the chip could be a modified version that lacks GPS, or Apple may simply decide not to enable the functionality in order to improve battery life. The company has said it expects users will have to recharge the Apple Watch nightly.

Other companies in the Apple Watch supply chain are said to be a wireless charging integrated circuit from Integrated Device Technology, NFC chips from both NXP and AMS, power management integrated circuits from Maxim Integrated Products and Dialog Semiconductor, a MEMS sensor from Invensense, microcontroller by STMicroelectronics, and Wi-Fi front-end by Skyworks.

The Apple Watch was announced earlier this month, but Apple focused on the design and level of customization available in the forthcoming wearable device, rather than specifications and storage capabilities. Even pricing remains a mystery, with the company saying the Apple Watch will start at $349, but no breakdown of sizes or collections given.

The Apple Watch is scheduled to go on sale in early 2015. It will include a heart-rate monitor, fitness tracking, support for Apple Pay and Siri, and will be the first Apple device to feature wireless inductive charging."
1586,"Two friends have a 20-year-old McDonald’s Quarter Pounder that they’ve keep safe for another friend for the past two decades. It was 20 years ago when the friend asked the two to pick up the Quarter Pounder for him while they were at the local McDonald’s, but he never showed up to eat the burger, according to 9 News on Feb. 16.

A 20-year-old burger, a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese, looks pretty much the same as a new Quarter Pounder looks today!
YouTube screen shot
It became a joke over the next few weeks when the friend still hadn’t claimed the burger, the buddies told him they'd keep it safe for him. Then that ran into months and now decades later, the Quarter Pounder is unwrapped and shared on a local news show. The two Australian buddies, Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, were only 14 and 13 at the time they purchased the Quarter Pounder with Cheese for their friend.

According to the Sidney Daily Telegraph, Dean states that he is pretty sure that this burger is the oldest burger in the world. While folk’s might store wine to age for 20 years, ground beef is not something you would eat after being left out a few hours, never mind decades.

Dean and Nitz recently appeared on the TV show “The Project” with their antiquated McDonald’s Quarter Pounder and it didn’t look as one might expect a 20-year-old burger to look like. The burger and bread didn’t sport any mold, discoloration or even a bad smell. It looked almost identical to a McDonald's burger just purchased today.

This Quarter Pounder has now taken on a life of its own with a new Facebook page that asks, ""Can This Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"" It got 3000 likes in just the first day it materialized.

The two Aussie buddies were about to take a bite of the very old burger in the name of charity, but the show’s host prompted them to put it down and skip this decades-old offering. The host protested and shared some common sense with the two friends and they obliged.

If the two buddies had eaten the old burger, chances are they would later break out in a fight as to who would use the bathroom first! They would most likely spend the remainder of the day hanging around the toilet bowl from eating meat that is so old."
1588,"Boko Haram has denied claims by Nigeria's government that it has agreed to a ceasefire and will release more than 200 abducted schoolgirls.

The group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being taken.

Nigeria's army announced a ceasefire with the militants on 17 October, saying the girls would soon be freed.

But violence has continued since news of the alleged truce, including a fatal bomb blast on Friday.

Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

'We will not negotiate'

In a video released on Friday, Abubakar Shekau said: ""We have not made ceasefire with anyone. We did not negotiate with anyone. It's a lie.

""We will not negotiate. What is our business with negotiation? Allah said we should not.""

Shekau also claimed that the militants were holding a German national, thought to be a teacher, who was kidnapped by gunmen in July.

There was no indication of when or where the group's latest video was shot.

The BBC's Tomi Oladipo in Lagos says the video will come as a huge embarrassment for the Nigerian government after it said it had secured a ceasefire with Boko Haram.

The Islamist militants sparked global outrage in April by abducting 219 schoolgirls from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok, in Borno state.

Their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Hopes were raised earlier this month when Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced a truce with the group.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""

But the Boko Haram leader said the girls were ""in their marital homes"" after being married off by the group.

Last week, Human Rights Watch said in a report that Boko Haram was holding more than 500 women and young girls captive and that forced marriage was common in the group's camps."
1589,"President Obama declared that the entire world was “appalled” by the beheading of an American journalist by militants in Syria, but vowed that America would not change course in Iraq, where the United States has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists, despite threats by the group to kill another reporter in the days ahead.

“The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people,” Mr. Obama said in a brief statement from Martha’s Vineyard, where he was vacationing. “We will be vigilant and we will be relentless.”

Before speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said he placed a phone call to the parents of James Foley, the slain reporter, telling them that Americans were “are all heartbroken at their loss.” He described Mr. Foley as a “journalist, a son, a brother and a friend who was “taken from us in an act of violence that shocked the conscience of the entire world.”

But the president’s harshest and most emotional words were reserved for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militants who released a video of the killing of Mr. Foley on Tuesday. American intelligence agencies on Wednesday verified the authenticity of the video, which shows a masked man decapitating James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago. It also shows another American captive, the journalist Steven Sotloff, and warns that he would be the next to die.

The president called ISIS a “cancer” in the region and accused them of having “rampaged across cities and villages, killing unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence.” He said it had committed torture and rape against innocent women and children and continued to enslave those they did not kill.

“No faith teaches people to massacre innocents,” Mr. Obama said. “No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and what they do every single day. People like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by people who build and not destroy.”

The killing of Mr. Foley triggered a fierce response. The New York Daily News and The New York Post both used the same banner headline on their front pages: “Savages.” Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain released a statement saying “the brutal murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved.”

At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement condemning ISIS for “the horrific murder of journalist James Foley, an abominable crime.” Mr. Ban said “the perpetrators of this and other such horrific crimes must be brought to justice.”

The four-minute, 40-second video was posted on YouTube but the website later took it down. Titled “A Message to America,” it shows Mr. Foley kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit in an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by Mr. Obama against the extremist group in Iraq."

Hopeless romantic Dim Xiong Chien planned to propose to his girlfriend, Cong Yen, in explosive fashion by setting off fireworks as he got down on one knee.

His would-be betrothed didn’t show up but as a last ditch effort, he set off the pyrotechnics in hopes that she’d see the fiery display, according to a report in the Express.

The plan bombed, though, when the fireworks set the grass ablaze at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang.

As firefighters rushed extinguish the massive blaze, Chien, 22, searched for his girlfriend, also 22, who forgot that he had asked her to join him for a walk.

“I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn’t shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire,” Chien said. “When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.”

The fiasco didn’t deter Chien, who decided to postpone the proposal.

1594,"(Update: The story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts.) News has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near Managua, Nicaragua late Saturday night, just 13 hours or so before the close flyby of 20-m asteroid 2014 RC, leading some to suggest that the two events are related. However, according to experts who have been examining the evidence, including those at NASA, the two events are completely unrelated, and the explosion in Managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space.

According to the Nicaraguan news site el19digital.com, an explosion occurred around 11:05 p.m. Saturday night, in the city of Managua, which apparently produced a crater that was over 12 metres (39 feet) wide and about 1.5 metres (5 feet) deep, in a wooded area just to the west of the city's international airport, and just south of the Pan-American Highway.

The video below, from RT.com, shows military personnel investigating the crater, as well as the surrounding area, for potential debris from the explosion.
While the incident is still being investigated, officials with Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies (INET), which monitors earthquake activity in the country, said that the event showed up on the agency's seismic instruments.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" Wilfried Strauch from INET said in a press conference, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). ""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound.""

However, while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion, the scientists have the seismic data from it, and they have the resulting crater, there are parts of the story that just don't add up.

A 20-metre wide asteroid named 2014 RC passed by Earth on Sunday, flying underneath the planet (from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere), and while there is roughly a 13-hour difference in the timing of these two events, some saw a potential connection between these events. It's not entirely unreasonable to suggest this. There are over 11,000 known near-Earth asteroids flying around the Sun, and very likely millions that we haven't detected (and likely won't, because they're too small). While most of these follow their own path as they circle the Sun, not all are alone. Some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them. Some are best described as 'rubble piles', which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulder-like shape by their mutual gravity. Others can be travelling along in 'packs' with some members preceding or lagging behind the 'pack leader' - possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point. So, if one of these asteroid 'packs' is flying by, or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit, it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground.

However, just because two events - an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact - happen close to one another, doesn't mean that they are related. We saw this back in mid-February 2013, when we were watching asteroid 2012 DA14 sweep by Earth and suddenly a 20-m wide asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence. 

According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Near Earth Object Office, that appears to be the case for this event:
A meteorite without the meteor?

An interesting fact about this supposed 'impact' is that, although the explosion was heard throughout the area, apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it. When a meteoroid enters the atmosphere, even if it is just a speck of dust, it is traveling so fast (typically around 17 kilometres per second or over 60,000 km/h) that it heats up the air in front of it, causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor. Larger objects cause even brighter flashes, earning them the name fireball,or even bolide (for an exceptionally large and bright one). Some of these are so bright that they can, very briefly, turn night into day as they pass overhead.

Given the weather over Managua on Saturday night (scattered clouds and calm winds), it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky, especially when it happened near a city of over 2 million people.

According to the Associated Press, Strauch said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Was it something else?

This lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story. While nearly all meteorites go through a 'dark flight' phase during the final part of their journey to Earth's surface - after it has slowed down enough that it isn't compressing the air enough to cause it to glow - their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere, some 20 to 30 kilometres above the ground, making them visible far and wide across the countryside.

Geoff Nodkin, professional meteorite hunter and host of Science Channel's Meteorite Men, tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic:
Notkin further commented that if it was meteorite-related, he would expect there to be a very bright fireball, sonic booms during the object's dark flight and then the impact. He also said that, to produce a crater like the one seen, it would have to be an iron meteorite, as they are the densest and ""have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on Earth""

In an interview with National Geographic, Donald Yeomans, the author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, said: ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

So, what was this, if it wasn't a meteorite? One very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion, as there are still thousandsIn cas buried throughout the country, remnants of the war fought there in the 1980s.

While this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time, it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day, as tons of material is swept up by Earth as the planet orbits the Sun. Many of these are missed because they occur during the day, or over regions of the planet that aren't heavily populated. Some countries have all-sky camera networks to capture these events, with data being reported on sites like SpaceWeather.com (U.S.) and the University of Western Ontario (Canada). As an example, there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in Managua, but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the Atlantic Ocean, over eastern Spain, as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video (note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one):"
1595,"The Apple Watch Sport may start at a mere $349, but the product line’s price point could well soar from there!

According to Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber, Apple’s 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition may sell for as much as $4,999.

“Most people think I’m joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000,” Gruber writes in a new blog post. “I couldn’t be more serious.”

Gruber notes that the device might cost $1,999 at a bare minimum, but this is unlikely since the components alone would cost more than this.

While $4,999 would give the Apple Watch Edition the dubious distinction of being both one of the company’s most expensive products and its smallest, Gruber points out that the device will not just be gold-plated, but actually manufactured using 18-karat gold.

With that said, is anyone going to want to regularly upgrade a solid gold watch that costs them the same as a Swiss watch which could conceivably stay in a person’s family for a lifetime?

For the record, Gruber thinks the stainless steel/sapphire Apple Watch will set customers back $999.

Guess we’ll find out for sure in early 2015, when the Apple Watch finally ships.

1603,"A year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it – maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive state’s ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.

An internal state document obtained by South Korea’s KBS TV station contains an “administrative order” from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his father’s successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.

The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it added.

The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul’s unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.

But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.

“Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” the official said.

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.

Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,” Park, who defected in 2008, said."

After airing the tape, anchor Don Lemon interviewed the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, who said the FBI had already interviewed both her and her client.

""He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building,"" Blumenthal said.

Lemon said Monday that CNN was still waiting on confirmation from the FBI.

""We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,"" Lemon said.

""I personally heard at least eleven,"" Blumenthal said."
1606,"(Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,"" Abdulrahman said.

""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING ""CLOSE EYE""

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.""

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

""We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.


The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the United States and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of Al-Qaeda which later became IS."
1610,"Ahmed Abdi Godane — the leader of al Shabab, the Islamic militant organization behind the siege on a mall in Kenya last year — was killed in a U.S. military strike earlier this week, an al Shabab source told NBC News on Friday.

The Pentagon confirmed the death later in the day.

“Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al Shabab,” said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. “The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations.”

A U.S. security official also told NBC News earlier in the week that Shabab had been killed by the strike on Monday. U.S. officials had said publicly after the strike that Godane was targeted, but that they were not sure whether he was dead.

The al Shabab source told NBC News that Godane was among 11 militants killed. Also killed were an operations leader, a financial official and a military strategist for the organization, the source said.

“It’s a big win,” the U.S. security official said. “He was operationally savvy and ideologically driven, with aspirations off the charts.” The official said that nine Hellfire missiles and one 500-pound guided bomb had been used in the strike.

The Reuters news agency reported Friday that the Somali prime minister had confirmed the death on Facebook, but Reuters later withdrew that report. A Somali government spokesman told Reuters that the government had not yet commented on whether Godane was dead.

The siege last September at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi left 67 people dead and about 200 injured.

The United States in 2012 offered a $7 million reward for his arrest. Godane took leadership of al Shabab after his predecessor was killed in an American airstrike in 2008."
1611,"Days before Christmas, Internet prankster Josh Paler Lin set out to capture a simple social experiment on video. The YouTube star, better known for his sex in bathrooms and mafia gags, decided that he’d give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he’d spend the money.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

The video, released on Monday, shows Thomas as he takes a stack of bills and walks right into a liquor store. But instead of booze, the homeless man walks out with a couple bags of food, heads over to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Moved by the selfless act, Lin then confronts Thomas and tells him that he’s being filmed.

“There’s things money can’t buy,” the homeless man says. “I get a happiness out of what I’m doing.”

With its surprising plot twist and selfless central character, Lin’s social experiment lit the Internet ablaze this week. By Saturday morning, the video had topped 24 million views and earned its creator international headlines. Meanwhile, the outpouring of support for Thomas became so great that Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to “help Thomas get a fresh start.” It’s now netted more than $112,000.

But if 2014 taught us anything about viral social-experiment videos, it is that viewers should be skeptical of their creators until proven otherwise. In the last year alone, they have duped millions by staging videos of cops racially profiling Muslims, creepy dudes trying to take advantage of drunk girls and even a video of a heroic Syrian boy rescuing a girl amid a barrage of bullets. Keeping these hoaxes in mind, we reached out to Lin on Friday night.

Josh Paler Lin embraces Thomas.   YouTube

By the time the interview was over, we were left with even more questions.

The YouTube prankster insists that he didn’t stage the video, and now has even bigger plans for the Internet’s latest folk hero. How Thomas feels about all of this remains unclear. After Lin’s video exploded on Monday, he says he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he’d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin will not disclose. Lin also says he has kept Thomas from speaking to any media.

During his interview with Vocativ on Friday night, Lin declined multiple times to let us speak with Thomas, though he claimed he was with him. However, Lin insists that Thomas is being well cared for. Over the last few days, Lin has published a number of photos on his Facebook page showing Thomas eating dinner at different restaurants with Lin and his friends. He says he has purchased Thomas a cellphone so the two can stay in touch throughout the day. Lin also says he’s taken Thomas to get a haircut and shopping at Nordstrom to “clean him up.”

“Basically I’m trying to help him get his life back together,” Lin says.

All of Lin’s hard work will be revealed on Sunday, when he plans to release a new video about Thomas on his YouTube channel. “It’s going to be an extreme makeover,” Lin says.

Then, following Sunday’s big reveal, Lin says he has another media event in the works where he will surprise Thomas with all of the money that’s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked about the money raised on Indiegogo and how the public could be certain that all of it goes to Thomas, Lin says his lawyers, agent and manager have everything “covered.” When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are “confidential.” He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ.

Lin bristled at the suggestion that any part of his original video had been staged or scripted. “Anyone who thinks that hasn’t ever met the kinds of people who are out there [on the street],” he says. “There is is no way we’re making this up. This is real. They don’t know Thomas. They don’t know his whole story.”"
1613,"Police in Mexico have found mass graves containing at least 15 charred bodies near where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week.

The burial pits were found Saturday on a hill in a community outside Iguala, Southern Mexico, the town where the students were last seen.

Witnesses claimed that they had last been seen being led away by police. Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero today, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week.

Inaky Blanco, is chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero.

He told a news conference in the state capital, Chilpancingo: 'We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site.'

Reports from the scene in the community of Pueblo Viejo said at least 15 bodies were exhumed from the site.

Iguala is about 120 miles (193 km) south of Mexico City in the increasingly violent state of Guerrero, the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men last week. At least six people were killed in a spate of incidents.

Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre said earlier this week that photos showed police had taken some of the students away.

Several hundred students protested on Saturday night in front of Aguirre's residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo, expressing anger that some of their classmates may be among the bodies found in the graves.

A car was overturned and several petrol bombs were hurled at the residence perimeter, where security outposts were lightly damaged.

Authorities found the mass grave as police are scouring the area for nearly four dozen people missing after a rash of violence. Guerrero was the site of clashes involving students, police and armed men, which started in late September

The graves were found up a steep hill after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location

If the students are in those pits, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date

A police official said on Saturday that there was video footage of eight to 10 students being put into police trucks earlier in the week.

Twenty-two police officers were arrested in Guerrero on Sunday, accused of killing two students during the clashes last week.

Aguirre said on Saturday that a total of 30 individuals have now been detained in connection with the incidents.

Local government officials criticized the police for showing an excessive use of force with the students in Guerrero, where gangs have evolved from a fragmented drug cartel and are fighting turf wars.

Thirteen of an original group of 57 missing people re-emerged this week. Some had hidden, others had gone home. Dozens are still unaccounted for.

Many mass graves have been found across Mexico in recent years and months, the legacy of drug gang violence that has killed around 100,000 people since 2007.

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing.

The police's links to organized crime has raised fears about the fate of the students in a country where drug cartels regularly hide bodies in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

'We are very worried. The families are very anxious,' said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

1614,"Texas City, Texas (CBS HOUSTON) –  A Texas plumber has been receiving endless calls and even threats after his Ford F-250 truck – featuring decals of his “Mark-1 Plumbing” company –showed up in a photo being driven by Islamic State militants in Syria.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated his Mark-1 Plumbing company in Texas City for over three decades, confirmed to CBS News that his pickup truck had indeed found its way to the front lines of Syria’s civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft vehicle. The photo surfaced on Monday after the Ansar al-Deen Front of ISIS militants posted it to Twitter with a man standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft weapon.
Oberholtzer told CBS News that he no longer owned the vehicle and has no idea how it ended up in Syria with the Islamic State militants.
Oberholtzer said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston on October 2013, and that was the last he’d seen of the truck. The photo clearly shows that both the company name and phone number are still in decals on the side of the vehicle. He told the Galveston Daily that he typically takes the decals off of vehicles being sold, but he left it on with the expectation that AutoNation would remove the company information.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
A spokesman for the AutoNation dealership told KHOU-TV that the truck immediately went to auction, and from there was likely traded to several owners before apparently ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists on the other side of the world.
By Tuesday, Oberholtzer said the company had received thousands of calls and faxes about the Twitter image from the ISIS militants – many of whom were accusing him of “aiding and abetting terrorists.”
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told KHOU-TV. “We had no intentions or no idea that this would even happen.”
“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror, it’s crazy. Never in my lifetime would think something like that,” said Oberholtzer. “We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.”
Oberholtzer says he hopes the ordeal won’t hurt business and that the company has “nothing to do with terror at all.”

1615,"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola, repots Mail Online.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.


Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease. Yesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said.

The action in Syria included 17 strikes near the cities of Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani. A variety of Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units were hit.

In Iraq, 12 strikes targeted Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units near the cities of Mosul, Fallujah and Sinjar.

Fighters, bombs and remotely controlled aircraft were used."
1619,"Vermin? They're totally in Vogue. 

According to staffers who work at the storied fashion bible, helmed by Anna Wintour, the brand-new Vogue offices at the Freedom Tower in downtown New York City are full of furry little friends – and no one thinks it's chic at all. 

""It's true,"" an insider confirms to PEOPLE. ""The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It's nasty."" 

According to a report on Gawker, Wintour, who recently made headlines for calling the magazine's April cover stars Kim Kardashian and Kanye West not ""deeply tasteful,"" is apparently refusing to enter her personal office unless it's rat-free. 

However, beyond the rodent problem, insiders say another issue the fashionistas are having is with the office's location itself – next to the former World Trade Center towers. 

""It's weird down there. You're always reminded of 9/11,"" a source says. Another adds, ""It just has creepy vibes."""
1622,"A blast that filled Nicaragua's 1.2 million capital Managua with dismay on Sunday night is most probably a meteorite that left a 12-meter crater near the city’s airport. The space rock might be a fragment of a larger space object that passed near Earth.

“We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the impact from the crater,” Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute said, as cited by the AFP.

Nicaraguan authorities are pretty sure it was a piece of an asteroid dubbed “2014 RC”, an estimated 20-meter large piece of rock that whizzed close past Earth, Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, told The Associated Press on Sunday. It was most clearly witnessed in the skies above New Zealand. At its closest, asteroid 2014 RC was a mere 34,000km from the Earth’s surface, about one-tenth of the distance to the moon.

Experts outside of Nicaragua, however, aren't so sure that the blast came from a meteorite. So far, not a single person has come forward claiming to have seen the object fly through the sky. Considering the size of the impact crater (about 39 feet), it should have also produced what the Associated Press termed “a ball of flame” that would’ve been easily seen by many people.

In a statement on Monday, NASA said it’s possible that a meteorite caused the crater, but the American space agency also expressed doubt.

""For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ... despite the population,"" NASA’s Bill Cooke said. ""So I'm very skeptical.""

Whatever the object was, its impact was severe and was heard throughout Managua. The meteorite crashed into a wooded area close to Managua’s Augusto C. Sandino International Airport around midnight and left a remarkable 12-meter diameter crater, 5 meters deep. However, no one was hurt and operations at the airport weren't interrupted.

The Seismic Institute registered two shock waves after the impact, the first one seismic, and the second stronger one – from the impact of the sound.

The locals living not far from the crater told media they heard an explosion, followed by sand and dust blowing through the air, accompanied by a burning smell.

“I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a big blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,” Jorge Santamaria told AP.
Nicaraguan authorities expect citizens to soon share photos and videos of the phenomenon, if they have any.

When the most spectacular meteorite of recent years exploded in the sky over the Urals city of Chelyabinsk last year, with the strength of 40 Hiroshima bombs, temporarily blinding and deafening thousands of people, a large number of video clips from dashcams and webcams helped RT make a video that became one of the most acclaimed in 2013 on YouTube.
The crash site near Managua was cordoned off and according to photos, Nicaraguan soldiers searched the crater with metal detectors to be sure the object was not manmade.

Later on government officials and experts visited the impact site.

The space body buried itself in the ground, which is confirmed by “Mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” one of the experts, William Martinez, told AFP.

So far, though, it remains unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or remains intact underground."
1623,"Meet 19-year-old Jess Smith.

18 years is a long time to keep a secret, and first-year dance education student Jess Smith couldn’t hold her tongue any longer.

“So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone,” Smith wrote on Facebook. “I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it. I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.”

— Where Are They Now? (@WATNCelebrity) December 23, 2014

Smith’s “Teletubbies” revelation that she was the laughing sun baby that watched over Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po in Teletubbyland, comes on the heels of the news that the BBC will make 60 new episodes of the television show.

A lot has changed since the British TV series first aired in March 1997. For one, actors will likely be paid more than the £250 and box of toys Smith was paid back then.

Smith’s decision to break her silence was prompted by an assignment at Canterbury Christ Church University, when students were supposed to reveal something about themselves that no one else would guess.

“I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them,” Smith told The Telegraph.

So how did the show’s producers get Smith to laugh for her signature shot? They didn’t. Her father Bill, a furniture deliver, made her laugh by playing with a teddy bear off camera.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad,” her mother Anji Smith said.

Even though almost two decades have passed, Smith’s smiling face hasn’t changed a whole lot.

What do you think? Does she still look like her Teletubbies character?"
1625,"OKLAHOMA CITY —You may have seen an article on social media about a town in Texas being quarantined because of Ebola.

The story was written on the website NationalReport.net, which is a satire news site. 

The story claimed the town of Purdon was quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the virus. The website also said road blocks had been set up keeping people out of the town.

Snopes.com, a website that examines rumors and urban myths, created an entry debunking the story after it was shared 79,000 times in nine hours."
1627,"THIS is the terrible moment a desperately poor young woman tries to sell her son – to fund life-saving treatment for her daughter.

Mum Meng Xiangyan faced a real-life Sophie's Choice when poverty forced her to decide between her twins.

The distraught 29-year-old said that she and her husband loved both of their children.

But with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: ""Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""

Medics say that the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

So far, there have been no offers on their son, who has not been named.

Their desperation follows on from a similar recent story in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: ""Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.""

In the four hours she sat with the sign, no-one bought her daughter."
1628,"American fears may be realized. One of the five Taliban members released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is believed to have returned to militant activity in Qatar.

CNN’s Barbara Starr reported Thursday that one of the Taliban Five may have reverted back to terrorism. Over the last few months, one of the men released has reached out to militants. The administration now suspects that he may again be a threat.

The White House was already facing renewed criticism for the deal made this summer. Many experts criticized the plan, saying it set a precedent to negotiate and exchange prisoners with terrorist groups.

The government of Jordan has indicated that it is willing to trade attempted suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi for Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

This week, NBC reported that the Pentagon will charge Bergdahl with desertion although no charges have been made yet.

Obama brought Bergdahl and his mother on June 1, 2014, to the Rose Garden to promote the deal that brought the soldier home. The slew of news surrounding the transfer vindicates those skeptical of the deal that the White House made without notifying Congress, as required by law.

At every turn, this decision has proven to be a bad deal for America’s security."
1630,"The leader of Islamist group Boko Haram has dismissed claims by the Nigerian government that it has signed a truce or agreed to release captives including the schoolgirls kidnapped in April.

A video handed to Nigerian media Friday showed Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau laughing away government reports that he had died or that his group had begun peace talks or signed a truce or had agreed to release the roughly 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April.

In the video, Mr. Shekau bristled with theatrical rage, speaking in front of several vans with heavy machine guns strapped to them.

Last month, Nigeria’s government had claimed that the group, which controls much of northeastern Nigeria, had agreed to a truce while it took part in peace talks. “We will not negotiate with anyone,” Mr. Shekau said.

Nigeria’s government spokesman had said the group had agreed to release every captive it has taken, including the 219 teenage girls kidnapped from a boarding school this year.

“A lie,” Mr. Shekau said. The girls, he added, had all been married off and converted to Islam. “They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.”

Some military officials had also suggested Mr. Shekau had died—the third time in four years that Nigeria’s government has made this claim.

Mr. Shekau mentioned holding a German hostage in the 13-minute speech, in which he veered from references to Islamic State, to obscure Nigerian politicians to a threat to “eat the heart of infidels.”

Officials working for President Goodluck Jonathan and Nigeria’s defense ministry didn’t answer calls to their mobile phones.

The sequence of events highlighted a credibility gap between a government that is seeking re-election and a militant group that has delivered on many of its threats.

Nigerian government officials have spent recent weeks touting their cease-fire as a campaign accomplishment: Mr. Jonathan is expected to clinch a second four-year term in February’s nationwide vote, but he is under pressure to show that the government’s five-year war against its local Islamist insurgency is bearing fruit.

Boko Haram has spent the past few weeks seizing a series of small impoverished towns in northeastern Nigeria.

On Wednesday, the group took control of Mubi, a town of 200,000 people, sparking an exodus that included Buba Markus, a local official. “I saw over 25 dead bodies scattered along the roadside,” he said."

1634,"ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has reportedly been killed by a U.S. airstrike, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

The ISIS leader was killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer. A Pentagon spokesperson did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users have passed around an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body. It was also reported by Iraqi News.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did say that any ISIS leaders “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was known as the world’s “most powerful jihadi leader” and “the new Bin Laden.”

“The true heir to Osama bin Laden may be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” wrote The Washington Post’s David Ignatius.

Many believe that as the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi helped the group eclipse al-Qaeda both in power and relevance in the region.

“For the last 10 years or more, [al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ] has been holed up in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and hasn’t really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos,” Richard Barrett, a former counterterrorism chief with the British foreign intelligence service, told Agence France-Presse. “Whereas Baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities, he has mobilized huge amounts of people, he is killing ruthlessly throughout Iraq and Syria…. If you were a guy who wanted action, you would go with Baghdadi.”

The reported killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi comes after the United States just took out a leader of the group al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist group. The leader killed, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was responsible for a the attack in a Kenyan mall last year that killed 68 people and left 200 more injured."
1637,"Big Bank Hank, a member of the early hip-hop group the Sugarhill Gang has died of complications from cancer at age 57. The group were responsible for one of the most popular rap songs of all time, Rapper’s Delight.

The musician died Tuesday at a hospital in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, a business manager for two former members of the group, and Aree Booker, a funeral director with Eternity Funeral Services.

Big Bank Hank, whose real name was Henry Jackson, was born in the Bronx borough of New York. He was a part of the Sugarhill Gang in 1979 when it had hip-hop’s first hit with Rapper’s Delight. The song was released as hip-hop began to emerge as a genre, and landed in the top 40 on the Billboard charts. It also peaked at No 4 on the Hot Soul singles chart, now called the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart.

The Sugarhill Gang, which was formed in Englewood, also included Guy O’Brien (Master Gee) and Michael Wright (Wonder Mike).

“So sad to hear about our brother’s passing,” O’Brien and Wright said in a statement issued through Mallie. “The three of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper’s Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.”

Rapper’s Delight became a success thanks in part to the late record label owner Sylvia Robinson, who released the song on Sugar Hill Records. Robinson, who was known as the “mother of hip-hop”, died in 2011.

After Rapper’s Delight, the trio had minor successes with songs such as Apache and 8th Wonder, but faded away. Their last album was a 1999 children’s rap album, Jump On It!

O’Brien and Wright currently perform under the name Rapper’s Delight Experience Featuring Wonder Mike and Master Gee, Mallie said. Robinson’s son owns the Sugarhill Gang trademark, and O’Brien and Wright haven’t been able to perform under the name since 2010, he said.

The pair were on good terms with Big Bank Hank before he died, Mallie said."
1638,"Talk about a story to make your skin crawl.
Australian Dylan Thomas, 21, was on vacation in beautiful Bali, Indonesia, when his body was invaded -- by a spider that had burrowed under his skin.
He awoke one morning to find a mysterious red trail stretching up his abdomen, which continued to creep higher throughout the day.
“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he told Darwin, Australia-based NT News.
Concerned, Thomas visited a hospital, where he was told it could be a small insect bite.
“So according to the doctors over here I've come down with some mystery condition,” he said in a Facebook post on Oct. 12 that included a photo of the scar. “Tad scary.”
Later that day, Thomas posted another photo that showed the scar beginning to ooze.
“It was a searing burn,” he said.
Turns out, it was a match-head-sized tropical spider that had burrowed into Thomas’ skin through his scar from when his appendix was removed recently.
“Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,” Thomas wrote in a follow-up Facebook post, showing off his freshly bandaged scar. “Haven't felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it's all over.”
While the experience literally got under his skin, Thomas has remained in good spirits throughout the ordeal, if his Facebook posts are any indication.
“Still hoping I'm going to develop superpowers by the time I'm home,” he wrote, joking about his fitting new nickname, Spider-Man. “I'll be highly disappointed if I haven't . . . Until the next time catch you later Bali.”

1640,"LONDON -- Stan Beaton lost his wife a decade ago, so he cherished the simple voicemail greeting she had recorded at their home in northern England.

Then, without warning, it disappeared; deleted by his phone service provider, Virgin Media.

When Virgin heard about his story, BBC Radio Leeds reports, they set a team of 10 employees to the task of bringing the audio back, and the radio station was on hand this week to surprise Stan with a sound he believed he'd never hear again.

""That's her,"" he says choking up as he hears his late wife's voice. ""Wonderful. Wonderful.""

As Stan himself point's out to the BBC Radio reporter sitting in front of him, ""I suppose it's gonna be a bit of a PR job now, but thank you, Virgin Media.""

He said he was ""staggered"" at the lengths the company had gone to to retrieve it.

1642,"The Scottish SPCA is appealing to the public for any information related to a dog that was found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase full of its belongings.
The dog, a male shar-pei crossbreed was found tied to a railing at Ayr Station, located in southwestern Scotland, last Friday. Next to the dog was a suitcase containing a pillow, toy, food bowl and food, the SPCA said in a statement Tuesday.
Scottish SPCA Insp. Stewart Taylor said the dog was microchipped, so the SPCA found out his name is ""Kai"" and was able to locate the dog's previous owner.
""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him,"" Taylor said in the statement.
Taylor said the case highlights the many risks of selling an animal online.
""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,"" he said.
The SPCA describes Kai as a ""lovely dog with a nice nature"" and estimates that he is between two to three years old. ""We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home,"" it said in the statement.
Under the Scottish Animal Health and Welfare Act 2006, abandoning an animal is an offence. Anyone found guilty of abandoning an animal can be banned from keeping any animals for a period of time or for life.

1644,"Jordan’s King Abdullah ibn al-Hussein, who has trained as a pilot, may fly a bomber himself on Thursday in the country’s retaliation against the ISIS.

Several Arabic-language newspapers reported late Wednesday that the monarch would personally participate in bombing raids on the terrorist group, citing his vow Tuesday to “strike them in their strongholds.”

The king was in Washington when news broke Tuesday of pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh’s demise at the hands of ISIS extremists. Meeting with the House Armed Services Committee shortly before leaving for Amman, he reportedly quoted the Clint Eastwood’s film “Unforgiven” and said that Jordan would pursue the jihadis until it ran “out of fuel and bullets.”

Rep. Duncan Hunter, who was in the meeting, told Fox News that given the ruler’s immediate and vehement reaction, “King Abdullah is not President Obama.”

Jordan, which has been a key American ally in the air war against ISIS, killed a number of ISIS-affiliated prisoners early Wednesday, as it had promised should Kasasbeh turn out to be dead, prior to the news of his immolation. Some have warned that the terrorist group deliberately deployed news of Kasasbeh’s fate in order to provoke a Jordanian overreaction. But public outcry in Jordan before and after the news seems to have pressured the government into a strong response, regardless of strategy. (RELATED: Jordan To Retaliate For Pilot Killed By ISIS)

Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that “nothing’s going to change” in U.S. policy toward ISIS as a result of Kasasbeh’s murder.

1645,"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi probably isn't dead, but no one who's in a position to know for sure is saying anything.

Rumors of Baghdadi's death exploded over the weekend on social media along with a photograph purporting to show his body. The photo was debunked as a fake by several sources and appeared to have been a doctored version of an image of an Albanian militant killed in Syria in 2013 that was published on the Arabic-language Yemeni hournews.net website.

But it's not clear what, if anything, actually happened to Baghdadi. Iraqi officials revealed Thursday that U.S. attacks killed one of his top aides and two others. The Iraqi newspaper Al-Sabah reported Monday that Baghdadi had been seriously wounded in the strikes.
The Pentagon hasn't weighed in on the matter since Thursday, when spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters the airstrikes had been directed against troop formations of the Islamist extremist group and if there were leaders with those troops ""they are likely to be killed.""

ISIS has emerged as a major new threat in the Middle East this year after adding a large portion of northern Iraq, including the major city of Mosul, to its holdings in Syria. It is seeking to establish a new Islamic caliphate as a challenge to existing governments in the region.

1646,"Late last month, as Apple fans were joyously spending their first days with the brand new iPhone 6 Plus, rumours began to swirl that putting the phone in your pocket could irreversibly bend it.

Twitter called it ""#bendgate,"" and the ensuing panic-storm got millions of people talking about the perils of skinny jeans, phablets, and buying Apple products.

As it turns out, however, #bendgate was a bust.

According to Apple, instances of phones bending in users' pockets were ""extremely rare,"" with only nine customers actually contacting the company about a curved iPhone 6 Plus within its first six days of sale.

So, naturally, we were a little bit skeptical when reports that the seam between the iPhone 6's body and camera lens had been pulling people's hair (and beards) out began to surface.

#Hairgate and #beardgate have been everywhere this week, with mainstream news outlets and social media users alike fanning the fire over Apple's latest perceived blunder.






Many are, in fact, referring to #hairgate as the new #bendgate — and we'd have to agree, based on the simple fact that they appear about as equally as legit.

""Having reviewed the iPhone 6 and currently being in possession of an iPhone 6 Plus... I can report the gap between the front glass and aluminium does not exist,"" writes Gordon Kelley for Forbes. ""There is a bevel, but the glass front panel is actually fused to the aluminium and the tiny gap you do see is significantly narrower than a human hair.""

Mashable conducted its own experiment to conclude that ""hairgate is a bust"" in an article called ""The iPhone 6 'Hairgate' Is Not a Thing.""

At least 10 people rubbed the iPhone 6 through their hair and over their beards vigorously in Mashable's video piece, none of them getting so much as a snag.

""After exhaustive amounts of research — we've gone with beards, curly hair, long hair, short hair, your hair, my hair — hairgate is not a thing,"" concluded Mashable's Christina Warren. ""Sorry guys, maybe next time.""

A species of magic mushroom has been found growing in the grounds of BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was astounded when he came across the funny fungi while filming a Christmas special at the Queen's London home - saying: ""I won't be eating any of that.""

The Amanita muscaria mushroom, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, is a white and red toadstool, with hallucinogenic properties.

The species contains poison which, in rare cases, can cause death if consumed.

Presenter Alan told The Sun he was surprised to happen upon the plants while working on The Queen's Garden, which will be screened on Christmas Day.

""That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are,"" he said.

Fly agaric are common and are understood to have grown naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there.

The hallucinogenic properties of the mushroom have been well-known for centuries and have a long history of use in religious and shamanistic rituals, according to the Kew Gardens website.

The prohibition reportedly stems from a January 2011 edict issued in Pyongyang, 11 months before Kim came to power after his father's death, that proposed that any North Koreans named Kim Jong Un ""voluntarily"" change their name, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.

""North Korea ordered its people not to use the name 'Kim Jong Un' in a bid to protect the supreme authority of the current leader,"" Yonhap said, adding that even the given name alone was off-limits.

""All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong Un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,"" KBS reported, citing a document it said had been provided by a North Korean defector.

Seoul government statistics show Jong Un is the ninth most popular given name in South Korea, where it is often transliterated differently from North Korea's spelling as Jung-eun. A well-known South Korean actress and music talk show host is named Kim Jung-eun.

North Korean state propaganda photos show their leader Kim Jong Un inspecting troops, conferring with generals, meeting an adoring public and even catching a basketball game with former NBA star Dennis Rodman.
The names of the North Korean leader's father and grandfather, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, the communist state's founder, were also reserved for their sole use, the media reported.

North Korea's leaders present themselves and their comrades from the ruling Workers' Party as austere revolutionaries but often engage in the same building of personality cults that marked the reigns of their imperial predecessors.


Kim disappeared from the public arena for 40 days this autumn, prompting speculation about a coup d'etat or failing health. He reemerged in mid-October after what sources said was an absence due to surgery to remove a cyst on his ankle.

1649,"A British-born U.S. photojournalist held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has revealed today.

Luke Somers had been held hostage since September 2013 in Yemen's capital Sana'a having moved to the country two years earlier.

His sister Lucy told Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents at 5am this morning.

'We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,' she said from London.

Scroll down for video

Lucy Somers said she learned of her 33-year-old brother Luke Somers' death from FBI agents

There was no immediate comment from Washington, nor from security officials in Yemen's capital, Sana'a.

Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill the hostage if its demands were not met.

Last week the U.S. said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages, including Mr Somers, but that he had not been at the site of the raid.

The family of Mr Somers had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who 'always believes the best in people.' She added: 'Please let him live.'

British-born U.S. photojournalist Luke Somers (pictured), who was being held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen, has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has revealed today

Luke Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen's capital Sana'a (shown in the map above)

Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times

His father Michael said Mr Somers was 'a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people'.

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English.

He said: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.'

Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'.

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers, threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group's demands

Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaida militants early Saturday, a security official said.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, the official said.

The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorised to brief journalists.

At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month.

Later Saturday, tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province.

American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen.

The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties, legitimising for many the attacks on American interests.

American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived

Begging for mercy: Luke's brother, Jordan (left), and his mother, Paula Somers (right), released a video on Thursday asking his al-Qaeda captors to release him

In a statement on Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a mysterious U.S. raid last month had sought to rescue Mr Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.

Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers, saying details remained classified.

However, officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border. Eight captives - including Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed.

Mr Somers, a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier.

Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen, where Mr Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.

1651,"In an effort to console a grieving boy after the death of his beloved pup, Pope Francis declared that ‘all of God’s creatures’ have a shot of ending up in heaven when they die. New York dog owners and animal lovers everywhere rejoiced at the good news.

Delighted city dog owners agreed Friday with Pope Francis’ comforting comment to a distraught boy that the lad’s recently departed canine would be welcome in the hereafter.

“That’s great!” said fashion designer Allina Liu as her pet pooch, Snoopy, hit the Union Square dog run. “All dogs go to heaven, right? There is no hell for dogs.

“There is hell for people who treat their dogs badly. People who treat their animals poorly just shouldn’t have them.”

The Pope, speaking earlier this week, offered his assurance of four-legged angels to the grieving child.

""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,"" he said during the weekly papal address.

“This marvelous plan cannot but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of God,” the pontiff said.

The Pope’s stance was also hailed by animal-rights activists. Though his dog dogma appeared unexpected, there had been earlier clues to the Pope’s feelings about the animal kingdom. He took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

Francis’ puppy views reverse opinions from previous popes, who maintained that heaven was just for human believers.

In a 2008 sermon, Pope Benedict XVI explained that not all creatures “are called to eternity” and when non-humans die, their deaths mean “solely the end of existence on earth.” The move seemingly barred pets from paradise.

Francis did not say if dogs could go to hell, too.

The puppy pardon is the latest move in his apparent campaign to make the Catholic church more inclusive and tolerant.

Earlier this year, he said gay men and women had “gifts” to offer the church, a dramatic shift in tone from the Vatican’s traditional anti-gay views. He also softened the church’s condemnation of premarital sex, cohabitation and divorce.

Health care worker Sarah Gluck, 26, said she was not religious, but definitely approved the Pope’s words.

“Dogs are a reflection of their owners; 99% of dogs go to heaven. But there’s always that 1%.”

Gluck said it’s too soon to know if her 4-month-old Australian shepherd will find eternal salvation.

“It’s hard to tell right now if Lilly is going to heaven because she’s so young,” said Gluck. “But if she goes to hell, it’ll be my fault.”

Dog walker Donna Bruno, 32, brought beagle-bulldog Hailey and Wheaten terrier Emma to the park with her.

She didn’t see how things could get any better for her canine charges.

“All dogs go to heaven?” Bruno asked as she watched the pair carouse happily with their equally excited pals.

“They’re already in heaven. Look at these guys,” she said.

1652,"The wels catfish, which was set free, could be one of the largest ever caught

An enormous catfish weighing 20 stone has been caught in Italy using only a fishing rod.

Dino Ferrari told GrindTV that he and his brother, Dario, lured it in with artificial bait and then battled the giant fish from their small boat for 40 minutes on Thursday.

After staying in the water to weigh and measure the specimen, which is one of the largest ever caught, they released it back into the river to swim another day.

Rod manufacturer Sportex Italia, which sponsors Mr Ferrari, claimed that the 2.67m wels catfish was a world record size to be caught with its Torpedo spinning rod.

It was found in the Po Delta, which is known for having the perfect living conditions for giant wels to flourish.

According to a British wels catfish website, they have hundreds “velcro-like teeth” used to hold prey before passing food to “crushing pads” at the back of the throat.

It records the UK record dating back to 1997 as a four-and-a-half stone fish caught in Bedfordshire.

The fish are not fussy eaters and have reportedly been known to feed on ducks, rats and even pigeons."
1654,"There may be easier — and less painful — ways to get closer to God.

An Indian spiritual guru and multi-millionaire has convinced up to 400 followers that they should cut off their own testicles, Metro reported.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, 47, said the castrations would bring the men closer to God.

The painful procedures were carried out at a hospital owned by Singh, who is worth $40 million.

He also has around 50 million followers worldwide. Singh has been dubbed the ""Guru in Bling.""

The men were castrated around the year 2000 but the cases are only now coming to light as Singh is accused of grievous bodily harm by India's Central Bureau of Investigation.

One lawyer for the alleged victims said the men were told ""only those who get castrated will be able to meet God.""

It is not the first time Singh has been in a scrape with the law.

In 2002 he was charged with conspiracy following the murder of an investigative journalist.

And several female followers have accused him of sexual assault, according to Metro.

Singh has never been convicted."
1656,"A video has emerged with claims that it shows a large, hairy figure walking swiftly through a snowy, wooded area in Russia. Key details about the incident are missing. But the visuals are remarkable.

Watch it here:

According to Mirror online, some Russian adventurers went in search of the elusive Yeti -- that's what many call Bigfoot in Russia -- after reports of creature sightings emerged from a remote region of the southwestern Adygea Republic in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The map below shows Adygea's capital city of Maykop.

The research team spoke to local residents who said they saw the unusual animal.

The Daily Mail reports that one eyewitness, Ludmila Hristoforova, told a local television station, ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.""

Another resident, Andrei Kazaryan (who Mysterious Universe suggests was one of the investigators), said, ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.""

The researchers claimed they captured that video footage -- seen above -- of the hairy Yeti. They also made a plaster cast of a large footprint found in the snow.

Both the video footage and the footprint cast are now reportedly in the hands of local scientists. Oddly, the names have not been revealed of those scientists or of the original researchers who say they took the video.

This story brings up other dubious questions:

Why no exact date or time of the alleged video encounter?

Why is it that, after the ""Yeti"" moves quickly through the snow from right to left, seeming to elude the research group as fast as it can, it suddenly stops its forward motion and casually turns to the right, not appearing to be in a hurry, almost as if it/he was waiting for further cinematic direction from those who were doing the videotaping?

This story is hot on the heels of two other Bigfoot tales we've reported on so far in January, including one that set off a huge controversy about a reported Skunk Ape photographed in Tampa, Florida.

There was also the one about how the Arizona Department of Transportation posted an image on its Facebook page, purporting to show ""a family of Sasquatches"" standing in snow next to a highway on Jan. 1. That turned out to be a little joke played on the public by Arizona state transportation officials.

We have a feeling 2015 hasn't seen the last of Bigfoot.

1658,"The Islamic State released a video of its jihadists beheading American journalist James Wright Foley in Syria. The video is almost five minutes long and includes threats against President Barack Obama and the United States.
In the video, which was temporarily available on YouTube but has since been removed, the terrorists remind the audience Obama authorized military action against IS and replayed Obama’s press conference when he announced the airstrikes. To them the declaration is a “slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.”
Foley then appears on his knees in an orange jumpsuit. He relays a message that the US government is his true killer. He addresses his family as well. The message is choppy, which gives the appearance that he is reading off cards placed in front of the camera.
His executioner speaks with what appears to be a British accent, saying many Muslims worldwide accepted IS and a war against IS is, in essence, a war against Muslims. The UK has been one of the Islamic State's most active targets of recruitment.
After he beheads Foley, he presents to the camera another journalist, Steven Joel Soltoff, who worked for Time and The National Interest. Soltoff was reported missing in the middle of last year. The executioner said America’s next move will determine IS’s next move in what appears to be a threat against the second journalist.
Foley was an independent journalist in the Middle East. In 2011, he was one of four journalists kidnapped by Qaddafi’s forces in Libya, of which he said in an interview with the Boston Globe, “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011... believe that front-line journalism is important.” He spoke at Northwestern University about his experience in Libya. His family had set up a website to help find Foley since his disappearance in Syria on Thanksgiving 2012."

Video captured dozens of shots fired as one shooter was killed by police, who continued to hunt for one or two other gunmen.

A soldier was shot at the National War Memorial in Ottawa by a gunman who ran to the the city’s Parliament building, where he was killed by law enforcement.

The area is on lockdown as police search for possibly two other gunmen following the Wednesday morning shooting.

A witness reported seeing a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun after the shooting, which brought a heavy police presence to the country's capital buildings where dozens of shots were exchanged between the suspect and armed law enforcement members.

A wounded person was photographed outside the Library of Parliament, in the middle of Centre Block, while the soldier was attended to beside the outdoor memorial before leaving in an ambulance. Police confirmed shots were fired at the memorial at 9:52 a.m. Wednesday.

The suspect is described as standing 5-foot-10-inches, overweight with a dark jacket and white scarf over his face. A witness described the suspect's car as a purple Toyota Corolla with no license plates. Two men reportedly got out of the vehicle, a witness told the National Post.

There was a major exchange of gunfire outside Parliament, according to reports.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is safe and has left Parliament Hill, his office confirmed.

Journalists have been forced to the ground at gunpoint after the shooting on Wellington Street, where some dozen shots were reported fired, The Globe and Mail reported.

Authorities fear the gunman may have headed towards the Chateau Laurier, a massive hotel just north of the Parliament building across the Rideau Canal. Police closed all city police stations to the public after the shooting, possibly in fear that the shooter may target law enforcement officials. And police ordered people in the downtown section of the city to ""stay away from windows and off roofs due to ongoing police incident,"" the department tweeted.

All three Canadian political parties were holding weekly caucus meetings at the time of the shooting, which sent people inside Parliament fleeing the building by climbing down scaffolding meant for construction, witnesses said.

The soldier, described as in his 30s, was shot in the abdomen and is in unknown condition after being taken to the hospital, the Ottawa Citizen reported.

The incident comes two days after a radicalized Quebec terrorist killed one Canadian soldier and injured a second with his car during a rampage in Montreal on Monday.

The extremist, a recent convert to Islam, at one point called 911 and told the operator that he was acting in the name of Allah.

1660,"Years ago, I had a job in China where I evaluated the spoken English of college students. One bright young woman introduced herself to me with her Chinese name. Then she added: ""You can call me 'Easy.' That's my English name.""

I paused, thought for a moment, and then decided to say something. ""You might want to consider changing your name,"" I said, explaining—as delicately as possible—that ""easy"" was an unfortunate name for a woman. Mortified, she thanked me for the tip. ""I'm going to go and change my name now,"" she said.

People in China have adopted English names for decades. Many choose ones that resemble their birth names: Chinese boys named ""Da Wei,"" a common name, almost invariably become ""David."" Others find inspiration from singers, athletes, politicians, or movie stars. In my first year in China, I taught five different boys called ""Tom Hanks,"" thanks in part to Castaway's success.

Most of the ""English"" names I encountered were conventional, though others—like the aforementioned ""Easy""—were less than appropriate. (I also taught a boy named ""Fish"" who, perhaps inspired by a certain musical artist, preferred to render his name by drawing it.)

Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""
CCTV, China's state-run broadcaster, wants to solve this problem. In an article published by its English-language channel, the network laid out a series of guidelines for how not to name yourself. For example, avoid naming yourself after a food item (""Candy""), a famous person (""Obama""), or a very old person (""Gertrude""). If you name yourself ""Satan,"" says CCTV, people might think you're anti-Christian, or worse, a ""member of a heavy metal band."" Proper and traditional names, like ""Michael,"" ""William,"" and ""Elizabeth,"" on the other hand, imply you're from a fancy and conservative family. Sweets-inspired names are ""typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.""

One wonders if certain American celebrities might not also benefit from these guidelines. For instance, here's what CCTV has to say about using food as a name:

""Food is very hit or miss. And usually miss. One of the issues here is that food names can be 'very' suggestive.""

1661,"Nicaragua's government said that a mysterious boom heard in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua's airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said on Sunday that a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

Murillo said Nicaragua would ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite has a radius of 12 metres and is 5 metres deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet on Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday night, but said they did not see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit."
1666,"OTTAWA – The gunman who charged into Parliament after shooting a Canadian Forces reservist was struck by nearly a dozen bullets from security officers and finally was brought down by Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers.

Several sources, who have requested anonymity, have confirmed that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was fatally wounded by Mr. Vickers near the door of the Parliamentary library.

Zehaf-Bibeau burst into the Parliament buildings after fleeing the National War Memorial, where he had shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and hijacked a ministerial car. He ran in to Parliament’s Centre Block through the main entrance with RCMP officers in hot pursuit.

A security service source says the gunman was intercepted by a House of Commons security guard who unsuccessfully tried to wrestle his gun away from him.


The guard yelled “Gun!” to warn his colleagues and tried to yank the barrel of the weapon down but Zehaf-Bibeau managed to fire, wounding the man.


The gunman then bolted several metres down the Hall of Honour with police and guards chasing him. More shots were fired.

Zehaf-Bibeau, his body riddled with bullets, huddled behind a column by the Parliamentary library. It was there that Mr. Vickers fired the fatal shots.

Mr. Vickers then walked to a nearby room where the Conservative caucus was meeting, and told MPs the shooter was dead. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was rushed to safety

Mr. Harper had been speaking to his caucus when the gunfight erupted.

“I had images of people hiding behind pillars and shooting,” said Manitoba Conservative MP Steven Fletcher. “There were so many shots.”


The police and military officers in the Conservative caucus sprang into action, including Manitoba cabinet minister Shelly Glover. They used chairs and tables to barricade doors that wouldn’t lock, while others began fashioning makeshift spears from flagpoles.

Ms. Glover said that for the former police officers in the room, training and experience kicked in. “Those boots I had on came off pretty quickly,” she said.

Mr. Fletcher, a quadriplegic, told his aide that if it came to it, she should leave him behind.

“I told my caregiver if the opportunity comes to get out, she has to take it,” said Mr. Fletcher.

1667,"While Bosnia has a widely publicised problem with underage pregnancies, a recent unverified report highlights the full extent of the problem.

A shocking case has been reported in the Bosnian press, claiming that seven primary school children from a small town, returned home pregnant after a five-day field trip.

The case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia where the number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 has increased significantly.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo said that the growing trend for underage pregnancies is worrying.

""It is worrying that girl 13 years old to have sex, but that is the trend of today. But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school.""

He added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education

""It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,"" he said.

According to InSerba News Network girls are seeking advice from experts, online. One schoolgirl wrote: ""I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged.""

Last year in Sarajevo 31 underage girls became pregnant.

1670,"Although the majority of Austrian resorts are suffering from a lack of snow there is one where it is business as usual – thanks to the fact that they stored snow from last year.

Resort managers in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in the state of Salzburg say their planned opening is going head as expected thanks to the fact that they saved up tons of snow from last year which they have now put back on the slopes.

Austria is one of the world's most popular skiing destinations and any delay in the usual season start at the beginning of December costs the industry millions.

But while most resorts in the Austrian Alps are currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tyrol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful, Saalbach-Hinterglemm has no such problems.

A recent Austrian climate report found the country’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 percent.

And although many resorts have shifted their focus to adaptation solutions, acknowledging that climate change will not be stopped or turned around any time soon, it is the ski resort at Saalbach-Hinterglemm that really planned ahead with the most success.

For the seventh year running the Snow Mobile event will be taking place in Saalbach-Hinterglemm as planned thanks to the snow that was carefully stored since March.

The resort management collected around 13,000-square-metres of snow from the mountains earlier in the year and then stored it by covering it with an artificial fleece and wood chips to keep it cool and prevent it from melting.

A spokesman for the resort said: ""We made sure the covering was airtight, and it paid off. We estimate we have lost about 15 percent of the snow that we put away which is pretty good going given that it's been such a warm year.""

The snow is currently being spread and flattened to allow the event at the weekend to go ahead as planned. Around 22,000 people are expected to turn up to watch."

This news shouldn't bring me so much joy, but Bleeding Cool rumormonger Rich Johnston is reporting that the Batmobile, or at least one of the Batmobiles used for filming Superman v. Batman: Paths of Glory, has been stolen. The movie is being filmed in Detroit, which hasn't been going through the best times of late. There's no official confirmation yet, but hey, maybe somebody needed it to drive out of town to get some fucking water.

Hey, their tax dollars paid for the breaks Warner Bros. gets for shooting in the state anyway, so when you look at it that way, the thieves were just taking back what was rightfully theirs!

But don't worry! The Outhouse has it on good authority that the theft wasn't at all malicious. It was just some people trying to win the prize in MTV's Steal the Batmobile contest from 1989!"
1672,"Going gold doesn't cost you extra when buying an iPhone or iPad, but a gold Apple Watch could potentially run you thousands of dollars. According to French website iGen, the premium, gold-plated Apple Watch Edition model will sell for up to $5,000, with the standard Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport retailing for $500 and $350, respectively. All versions are rumored to arrive on Feb. 14.

So what does $5,000 get you? According to its description on Apple's website, the Watch Edition model sports an 18-karat gold watch case that is designed to be ""twice as hard as standard gold."" The watch utilizes a sapphire crystal display, and can be outfitted with either a leather or sport wristband.

MORE: Apple Watch Hands-On

The less luxurious (but still suave) Apple Watch packs a stainless steel case that comes in black and silver, with the option for either a leather band or one of several steel bracelets. The Apple Watch Sport, rumored to be the most affordable of the bunch, has an anodized aluminum case and uses plastic wristbands.

We'll have to spend more time with the Apple Watch to see how it stacks up to devices like the LG G Watch R and the Samsung Gear S, but, if these rumors hold up, Apple will at least have the title of ""most expensive wearable"" secured. If the Watch Sport is Apple's lowest-end smartwatch at $350, it's still more expensive than premium-looking Android Wear watches like the G Watch R.

If you do have the cash to blow on these potentially high Apple Watch prices, you can at least surprise your significant other with one. The watch is currently rumored to arrive on Valentine's Day 2015, though Apple's website still lists a vague ""early 2015.""

He was dragged and taken to a local butcher shop where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour. Thereafter, his asset was hacked with a meat cleaver and dumped in the middle of the road.

1678,"A secret government document has been leaked revealing the ""administrative order"", telling authorities to ensure no one else is named ""Kim Jong-un"".

And if people don't agree, then to ""train them"" to change it.

It is believed anyone with the same name would be forced to have official documents, identity cards and even school certificates altered.

And officials have been told to reject any birth certificates for the name.

The internal policy was obtained by South Korean news station KBS TV and highlights some of the leader's craziest rules.

His name game was said to have been set up by a directive shortly after cheese-loving Kim was made Supreme Leader.

And he will find you...UH-OH: And he will find you... [AP]
“We'll train them to voluntarily change their names.”
The document reads
The document reads: ""All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project.""

It is unsure whether the directive is authentic but officials have said that the names of each North Korean leader in the past - Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il - have been banned.

Yet North Korean defector Park Jin-hee, who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive was real.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un.""

The news comes after accusations emerged that North Korean officials hacked Sony Pictures and leaked a number of future productions.

1679,"A video allegedly showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria for 636 days, by the terror organisation the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), was released today. In their video, which has not been verified yet, the group claims that the beheading is “a message to the US to end its intervention in Iraq.”

According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)the freelance journalist was abducted by an “organised gang” in northern Syria on November 22, 2012.

On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria. Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.
Condolences are pouring on the Free James Foely page, set up by family, which was set up after his kidnapping and which had appealed for his release unharmed.

Zaid Benjamin, a Washington DC-based journalist, tells his 43.3K followers on Twitter, posting still photographs taken from the video:

Benjamin's Twitter account has since been reportedly suspended for about half an hour – for sharing footage from the video at the centre of this story. The account has now been restored.

The video, which has also been removed from YouTube, has sparked a discussion online on whether such material should be permissible on the world wide web on the grounds that it allows the ISIS to share its “propaganda.” Brown Moses provides a transcript of the video here.

Ruwayda Mustafah, a UK-based Kurdish blogger with around 40K followers on Twitter, notes:

Like many, Mustafah calls for an ISIS blackout on social media:

Online, the ISIS has been active showing off its horrific exploits in Syria and Iraq for the world to see. The ISIS came to prominence last year after Jihadists from around the world joined its fighters in Syria, first to fight against the Assad regime, and later to fight other armed factions in the war-torn country. In June, the Al-Qaeda splinter group, which controls parts of Syria, annexed Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, as the world watched in horror.

1680,"The Apple Watch reveal back in September was big on excitement, but short on details. Among those things that Apple failed to mention was whether or not Cupertino’s new smartwatch will be able to withstand liquids — making it suitable for, say, swimming or washing the dishes.

While we still don’t have a final, definitive answer on what is and is not advisable with the Apple Watch, Tim Cook shed a bit of light on the mystery during a Q&A session with staff at the Kurfürstendamm Apple Store in Berlin, Germany, where he is currently visiting. Cook said that that he wears his Apple Watch “even in the shower.”

This is in contrast with what we had previously heard, courtesy of tech journalist David Pogue, who after a private briefing with Apple advised readers that, “Sweating [while wearing the Apple Watch], wearing it in the rain, washing your hands, or cooking with it is fine. Take it off before the swim or get in the shower, though.”

As much as we respect Pogue, you’d have to say that — when it comes to Apple advice — Cook trumps Pogue!

The Apple CEO also answered a few other questions in what sounds like an interesting session. Among them was a bit more clarification on the Apple Watch’s battery life, with Cook saying he removes the device to recharge overnight — something we’ve suspected based on previous reports.

Cook talked about some of the possible applications of the Apple Watch, including monitoring auctions on eBay — or else accessing hotel rooms in a way similar to existing apps for the iPhone.

Answering a question from a visually impaired employee, he said that the Apple Watch will have more accessibility features added over time, although it sounds like these features will be limited at first.

No price tariff was given for the device, but Cook confirmed that Apple will begin marketing the device in April. In what sounds like an amusing moment, Cook sidestepped the question of whether retail staff could have all have an Apple Watch to more easily show customers, by saying that it is a “good idea” and that he would “consider it.”

Cook also spoke about his efforts to improve working conditions in China, and lamented the fact that the media often choose to paint Apple in a bad light in this regard. Cook said that Apple is trying to ensure that there is no abuse of employees on the supply chain, and that they work fairer numbers of hours.

Finally, he addressed the reports that Apple Pay could be available in Europe soon by saying that Apple aimed for this to be the case “before the end of the year.”"
1681,"(CNN) -- Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in spring have been converted to Islam and married off.

Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group.

The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping in April at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials.

""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?"" Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.""

Shekau slammed reports of their planned release.

""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling.

The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram.

""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator.

It wasn't clear when the video was made.

Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told CNN on Saturday that all these claims contradict those made in conversations in which the Nigerian government has been involved.

Omeri said Nigeria's government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide.

The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad.

That day passed without any signs of the girls.

Boko Haram a growing challenge

In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun.""

This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead.

Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday.

Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said.

For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down.

Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday.

The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram.

Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said.

Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state.

The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government.

As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

Shane Smith, the co-founder and chief executive of Vice Media, has taken his place among the high-rollers in Las Vegas after winning $1m at the Bellagio casino and spending $300,000 of his winnings on a meal for more than 30 employees and business partners.
The lavish meal at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse took place during the Consumer Electronics Show. It included bottles of wine costing $15,000 each and was so expensive it merited a mention on the quarterly earnings call of MGM Resorts, the group which owns the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casino hotels.

Jim Murren, MGM Resorts chief executive, told analysts on the call that he had not seen a meal with such a hefty price tag since 2007. “It tells you there is a release valve that has opened,” Mr Murren said. “That isn’t a trend, but it’s a sign people are ready to spend money again.”
Despite the meal’s eye-watering price tag, Mr Smith is not the biggest spending media chief executive to play the Las Vegas tables. Kerry Packer, the late Australian billionaire, was a regular in Las Vegas and was known to bet as much as $150,000 a hand. His visits to casinos often made the difference between gaming operators reporting profits or losses in their quarterly earnings.
Mr Smith’s identity as the buyer was first revealed by Bloomberg. He declined to comment on the meal.
However, Vice Media is not lacking in confidence. The youth-focused company will go on a “deal spree” in 2015 and explore an initial public offering if market conditions remain favourable, Mr Smith told the FT in December.
The company has strengthened its senior management team with the appointment of James Schwab, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as co-president, who will help oversee a $500m “war chest” for content, technology and distribution deals.
“Vice will go on a deal spree in 2015,” said Mr Smith. “Our war chest is the size of the full valuation of our competition so we will see some major . . . deals happen.”

The $500m fund came from A&E Networks, which invested $250m in Vice recently for a 10 per cent stake, valuing the company at $2.5bn. Technology Crossover Ventures, the Silicon Valley fund that has stakes in Facebook and Netflix, also invested $250m in the group.
Vice, which in 2013 also took a strategic stake from 21st Century Fox, wanted to stay independent, said Mr Smith. “We would be stupid not to think about an IPO.”
The company has recently been engaged in a war of words with Gawker, a rival site, which has in several stories accused Vice of underpaying its employees. Vice hit back in a blog post, accusing Gawker of “garbage, click-bait journalism” and “inaccurate and irresponsible” reporting."

As shown in the freeze frame below, smoke is shown to emit from the weapon, with no impact or trauma appearing to register on the body of the victim. The decision of many news outlets to blur out the victim is being debated as evidence of complicity in what many are now calling a hoax.

Comme ont annoncé plusieurs médias (en prenant soin de mettre un point d’interrogation à la fin de leur titre, pour qu’on ne les accuse pas de propager des nouvelles-vidanges), le réalisateur de Star Wars epsiode VII, J. J. Abrams, aurait dit, au cours d’une cérémonie où il a reçu un prix de la part du Visual Effects Society (VES) le 4 février, qu’il souhaitait que Disney devance la sortie de son film à cet été.

Wow! Nous qui attendions avec impatience la date de lancement officielle, prévue pour le 18 décembre!!

Comme vous l’apprenait Métro récemment, les médias sautent souvent sur une nouvelle sans vérifier les informations de bases. Examinons:

1. Tous les articles offrent comme source les sites iKwiz et Moviepilot.

2. iKwiz est un site qui offre des quiz et du contenu léger sous forme de listes. Ce n’est pas un site de nouvelles.

3. Moviepilot base son reportage sur cette vidéo YouTube qui apparaît sur… le site iKwiz.

4. Donc: tous les articles à propos de cette rumeur se basent sur une seule vidéo YouTube, qui, il faut le mentionner, n’a pas été créée par un journaliste. Le vidéaste ne mentionne aucune source pour son information.

5. Voici un article écrit le soir des VES sur la présence de J. J. Abrams. Aucune mention de la date de lancement de Star Wars.

6. Voici une entrevue avec M. Abrams lors des VES. Encore une fois, aucune mention de la date de lancement.

7. Le Twitter officiel de Star Wars a réagit le 10 février sur ces rumeurs. On écrit «Maintenez la cible! Seulement 310 jours avant #TheForceAwakens.» La date de lancement originale est donc reconfirmée:


8. Disney studios n’ont toujours pas répondu au courriel que leur a lancé l’inspecteur viral, sollicitant une confirmation officielle. Il mettra à jour son article, au cas échéant.

Mais, encore plus ridicule:

9. Disney lancera Jurassic World cet été. Est-ce que Disney ressusciterait deux franchises-phares en même temps, séparant ainsi le revenu et l’attention médiatique? Voyons.

10. Disney lance aussi un autre film à gros budget cet été: Ant-Man. Le terrain commence à être pas mal serré pour Disney.

11. On ne peut pas devancer un film de six mois sans causer des problèmes majeurs de logistique, surtout pour un film comme Star Wars, où la myriade de joujoux et autres boîtes à lunch à l’effigie des personnages fait partie prenante du lancement.

Journalisme 101, les amis. Le web est un endroit étrange."
1688,"Editors' note: This image, which is unique according to a reverse image search done on Tin Eye, was posted on the @Banksy Instagram account to its nearly 1 million followers. It is not, however, confirmed to be an official account operated by the artist. It could be Banksy, but the artist's real accounts are unclear. We've changed the headline and story below to reflect that.

A popular Banksy Instagram account weighed in on Wednesday with a powerful homage to the murdered journalists at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, victims of a horrific terror attack.

Take a look:

A photo posted by Banksy (@banksy) on Jan 1, 2015 at 3:02pm PST

The account, which has nearly one million followers — though it is not known to be an official Banksy Instagram account — posted a picture on featuring three pencils — the pencil fully intact is next to the word ""yesterday,"" a broken pencil represents ""today,"" and the resharpened shard shows there will be two pencils ""tomorrow.""

It adds: ""RIP,"" joining scores of other cartoonists and artists who have been sharing tributes throughout the day.

Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, who remain at large. No arrests have been confirmed in the hunt for the attackers, though an ""anti-terror raid"" is reportedly underway in the northeastern city of Reims.

The brothers, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.

Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.

Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.

The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.

1689,"Islamic State fighters are no match for Ebola.

The World Health Organization is investigating whether some ill jihadists have contracted the killer disease, two sources at the agency told The Post.

Agency officials are checking if there are Ebola patients at a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad, sources said.

Al-Sabah, an Iraqi pro-government newspaper, reported this week that the fighters were being treated for Ebola, while some of their comrades have come down with HIV brought by foreign extremists “coming from many countries, particularly those in Africa.”

“The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don’t have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus,” ministry spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told Iraqi media Thursday. “They are incapable to detect it.”"
1690,"A Canadian-Israeli woman who has joined the ranks of the Kurdish militias fighting Islamic State in northern Syria has been taken captive by ISIS fighters, blogs and Islamist websites thought to be close to the militant group reported.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Gill Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

According to Israel Radio, Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighbouring Syria.

""They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,"" she told Israel Radio, explaining her decision to enter the combat zone in northern Syria.

A source in the Kurdistan region said Rosenberg, known in Israel by her Hebraised first name Gila, was the first foreign woman to join Syrian Kurds in battle, in addition to several Western men who are fighting in their ranks.

""After me""

A Facebook page registered to Rosenberg showed photographs of her in settings marked as Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria.

""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means,"" read a Nov. 9 post.

Rosenberg had consented to extradition and served around three years in a U.S. prison under a plea bargain, her lawyer said. A 2009 FBI statement on the case names her as Gillian Rosenberg, among 11 people arrested in Israel ""in a phony 'lottery prize' scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly"".

Israel's NRG news site reported at the time that Rosenberg turned to crime after running short on money, that she was estranged from her parents and had tried in vain to join the Mossad spy service.

""She is incredibly strong, both in mind and in body,"" said long-time friend Daniel Lieber in Massachusetts. ""She has always been someone interested in politics and is very pro-Israel.""

Discreet ties

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries. The Kurds are spread through Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran.

Worried about spillover from the Syrian war, Israel has been cracking down on members of its 20-percent Arab minority who return after volunteering to fight with Islamic State or other rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule.

Israel bans its citizens from travelןng to enemy states, among them Syria and Iraq, and officials did not respond to a Reuters inquiry about whether the woman could face prosecution if she returns to Israel.

1692,"They haven’t verified that the recording is what it claims to be, but with competition for this story among the media so ferocious, go figure that they’d choose to put it on the air and worry about authenticity later. As of last night, the FBI was investigating; between the guy’s IP and the fact that the video file is presumably timestamped, I assume they’ll be able to verify or debunk it quickly. It could be a prank — the man who recorded it seems to be, er, “enjoying” a video chat while it happened — but what he’s caught saying is tame. If you were going to prank CNN by getting them to air something sexually explicit in the name of reporting news, you’d be more explicit than this, no?

If it’s authentic, it tells us how many shots were fired. The man’s attorney tells Don Lemon she hears 11 shots. I hear 10. A forensic examiner who listened to the tape told CNN he heard “at least 10,” six shots followed by a pause followed by four more. The autopsy report from the family’s forensic pathologist claims Brown was hit at least six times, all from the front. That means that he was hit at least twice in the first flurry of six shots heard here, and furthermore that he was facing Wilson at some point during that flurry. It’s bizarre to me that Brown would have turned back to face a man who was still in the process of firing at him at fairly close range, but I don’t know what other conclusion can be drawn based on what we know. The fact that Brown had apparently been wounded before the fateful pause, during which he either rushed Wilson or tried to surrender, is also important. The prosecution will argue that Wilson, having already drawn blood, should have realized that a weakened Brown was no longer as much of a physical threat. Wilson will argue that he felt threatened precisely because Brown allegedly kept coming after he was wounded. A man strong enough to take two shots and angry enough about it to advance on a cop with a gun was lethally dangerous, he’ll say.

Here’s how Brown’s friend, Dorian Johnson, described what happened to them:

Now, in line with the officer’s driver’s side door, they could see the officer’s face. They heard him say something to the effect of, “what’d you say?” At the same time, Johnson says the officer attempted to thrust his door open but the door slammed into Brown and bounced closed. Johnson says the officer, with his left hand, grabbed Brown by the neck…

At that moment, Johnson says he fixed his gaze on the officer to see if he was pulling a stun gun or a real gun. That’s when he saw the muzzle of the officer’s gun.

“I seen the barrel of the gun pointed at my friend,” he said. “He had it pointed at him and said ‘I’ll shoot,’ one more time.”

A second later Johnson said he heard the first shot go off…

Johnson says he was within arm’s reach of both Brown and the officer. He looked over at Brown and saw blood pooling through his shirt on the right side of the body.

“The whole time [the officer] was holding my friend until the gun went off,” Johnson noted.

Brown and Johnson took off running together. There were three cars lined up along the side of the street. Johnson says he ducked behind the first car, whose two passengers were screaming. Crouching down a bit, he watched Brown run past.

“Keep running, bro!,” he said Brown yelled. Then Brown yelled it a second time. Those would be the last words Johnson’s friend, “Big Mike,” would ever say to him.

Brown made it past the third car. Then, “blam!” the officer took his second shot, striking Brown in the back. At that point, Johnson says Brown stopped, turned with his hands up and said “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”
According to Johnson, then, the first shot to hit Brown was fired while Wilson was still sitting in the squad car struggling with him, which at least would explain how Brown was hit from the front during the first flurry. Brown then managed to run three car lengths before Wilson — presumably still inside the car — fired his second shot, hitting Brown in the back. We know from the autopsy report that the last detail is false; after listening to this audio, the timeline on the first part seems false too. There’s virtually no delay between the first and second shots fired, certainly not long enough for words to be exchanged between Brown and Johnson. Unless the audio here picks up after the first shot was fired, i.e. unless it begins with what’s actually the second shot fired at Brown, I don’t know how to square Johnson’s account with this.

Here’s what the NYT said about what eyewitnesses have told police:

Some of the accounts seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfolded: with a struggle between the officer, Darren Wilson, and the teenager, Michael Brown. Officer Wilson was inside his patrol car at the time, while Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, was leaning in through an open window.

Many witnesses also agreed on what happened next: Officer Wilson’s firearm went off inside the car, Mr. Brown ran away, the officer got out of his car and began firing toward Mr. Brown, and then Mr. Brown stopped, turned around and faced the officer.
That seems more likely than Wilson squeezing off a bunch of rounds while still inside his car. But in that case, since there must have been a delay of a second or two between the first shot that went off inside the car, Wilson getting out of the car, taking aim at Brown, and then firing again, where’s that delay on the audio? The first six shots are basically continuous.

Exit question: Can anything be discerned from the length of the pause between flurries? Johnson says Brown put his hands up and tried to surrender, saying, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” Wilson’s alleged friend, Josie, told Dana Loesch that Brown taunted Wilson and then rushed him. Does the length of the pause here rule either of those out?"

1699,"On Friday, Esquire.com's Ben Collins wrote a blog post in which some awkward phrasing made it appear as though tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown on ESPN will feature a special panel discussion on domestic violence.

Here's how his post starts:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.
Collins's outrage at ESPN's failure to include any women in a discussion dedicated to domestic violence was shared by many, and word of the ""panel discussion"" began to spread across Twitter:









And then there were a lot of other blogposts, piggybacking off of Collins's, with headlines like these:

ESPN Doesn't Get It: They Ignore Women's Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence
ESPN's Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important
11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight's ESPN Domestic Violence Panel
ESPN's Domestic Abuse Tonight Panel Will Be 100% Dudes

And then feminist organization UltraViolet blasted this press release to various media outlets:

UltraViolet Calls on ESPN to Include Women in Discussion About Domestic Violence

Statement from Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, on ESPN's announcement that a 11 man panel will discuss domestic violence during their Monday Night Football pre-game roundtable:

""By having a roundtable on domestic violence and not including any women, much less survivors of domestic violence, the panel is the height of ignorance by ESPN. ESPN must be getting their PR advice from their buddies at the NFL. Both the NFL and ESPN seem to greatly misunderstand the problem they are trying to address and the millions of people's lives it effects.""

While it's good to see ESPN taking on the issue of domestic violence within the NFL tonight, we strongly believe that they should also include the voices of women and survivors of domestic violence at the table. With nearly 45% of NFL fans and viewers being women, including women at the table not only would add to the discussion but would address the realities of their audience and the issue at hand.""
But tonight's episode of Monday Night Countdown is just going to be a regular episode, and will not be featuring any special discussion about domestic violence. We reached out to ESPN PR, who told us that talk of the special panel was ""false info"" and that tonight will feature a ""regular episode of Countdown hosted by Suzy Kolber.""

There are certainly criticisms to be made of Monday Night Countdown fielding such a dude-heavy panel that is painfully ill-equipped to speak intelligently about any issue of substance, as has been proven in the past. Tonight, however, it's highly unlikely that domestic violence will even come up.

Update: And here is a statement from ESPN:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more."
1700,"My wrists and I have had a troubled relationship since last week.

Ever since Apple revealed its vast array of watches, my lower forearms have looked up at me and hissed: ""Well? You're going to leave us naked?""

So I spent some time yesterday browsing Apple's site and perusing all the different types of watches that will soon be available.

The fancier model -- the so-called Apple Watch Edition -- does look relatively lovely on tiny female forms. But how much might it cost? All Tim Cook offered last week was that the watches -- the cheapest presumably being the sporty ones you'll sweat all over -- will start at $349.

Then along comes influential Apple observer John Gruber to insert a little informed perspective.

""Apple Watch is not a product from a tech company, and it will not be understood, at all, by the tech world,"" he said.

This incites a kaleidoscope of optimism for those who find tech minds frightfully insular. For Gruber, the higher-end watches -- the Apple Watch made of stainless steel and the Watch Edition adorned with 18-karat gold -- will be competing directly with fancy watches.

What they will offer is a (hopefully) gorgeous watch with some fancy gizmos attached.

It's a persuasive concept, one that makes your standard Rolexy thing a klutzy lump of gold that can merely tell the time and make you look like something of a exhibitionist half-wit.

However, if you want your artistic creation to seem valuable, you have to price it as such. So Gruber wagers that the stainless steel Apple watch will start at around $999. The Edition, however, he places at $4,999.

In his words: ""I think Apple Watch prices are going to be shockingly high -- gasp-inducingly, get-me-to-the-fainting-couch high -- from the perspective of the tech industry. But at the same time, there is room for them to be disruptively low from the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry world.""

The thing that's missing currently is the full gamut of what Apple's watches will be capable of doing. We've seen the basic hardware, but we don't know that much about the software.

Between now and their launch -- some time in 2015 -- Apple's team has time, surely, to develop and keep in secrecy all sorts of amusing functionality. This functionality will keep your first date enthralled for hours as you waft your Apple Watch before his or her mesmerized eyes.

Not only will you seem to be a person of means, but one who means to know where the world is at.

Even if the fanciest of its watches costs $4,999, Apple still has the problem of obsolescence and general pain-in-the-buttness.

Do you really want an extra item to charge every night? Do you really want to replace your watch every couple of years? Or might there, as Gruber suggests, be a nifty software-update solution so that you don't have to toss it in the drawer next to all your old iPhones?

What's most important here, though, is that Apple is proving ever more that what is conventionally called tech is not its main domain.

We humans are posers, as much if not more than we're thinkers. We sift the world through imagery, rather than substance. Somehow, substance is a more shifty essence than is our world of impressions.

Impressions are instant, substance takes time. There are too many demands on our time for us to bother to dig deep into the substance of everything (or even anything much at all). So we sift our world by looking at it and absorbing impressions.

MORE TECHNICALLY INCORRECT

GoDaddy makes very funny ad (no, really)
Samsung hires Kristen Bell to help you forget about Apple
Apple's watches will exist first to make certain impressions. Buried a little deeper, however, will likely be a certain substance that is unique to these fashion accessories. This is what Apple means when it says these are the most ""personal"" devices it's ever made.

It's like any relationship. You're first moved by looks. Then you hope that there's something more behind them, something that will be the glue that creates a deeper, longer-lasting bond.

You might choose to pay $4,999 or even more for a gold Apple Watch Edition. But you'll need it to be more than just a pretty face. And that's where Apple hopes to make a killing."
1702,"Apple crushed its introduction of the Apple Watch yesterday in Cupertino, but while Kevin Lynch and Jony were waxing poetic about the design of watch and its revolutionary UI, there was one feature everyone steered clear of: battery life.

Other than introducing the new inductive charging cable, Apple was mum on how long its timepiece will stay charged. According to a report from Recode, that’s because Apple is still trying to improve it ahead of the early 2015 release, but sources say Apple Watch battery life currently last about a day, and will require nightly charging.

Apple staff in the hands-on area after the show also wouldn’t provide battery life estimations either, but Apple PR spokeswoman Nat Kerris told Recode it should last you throughout the day.

“There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day. We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”

Barely squeaking out 24 hours of use will surely be a disappointment for some users, but it’s on par with most other smartwatches on the market. No word on if the two different sizes will have different battery life as well. The Apple Watch is expected to go on sale in early 2015 at an introductory price of $349, while the Sport and Edition models are expected to cost more."
1707,"A devoted pet owner has spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated.

The man, who has not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste.

He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300.

The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead.

Scroll down for video

The pet owner, who has not been named, took his goldfish (pictured) to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham, Norfolk, and paid £300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, put anaesthetising agent into the fish's water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body. The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operation

Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside.

A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner.

Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated.

She said: 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp.

Vet Faye Bethell, 29 (pictured), carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish

'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated.

'The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died.

'There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.'

The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish's water.

It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills.

Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps.

She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue' to cover and waterproof the fish's scales before it was gradually re-awakened.

Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation.

The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets.

Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake.

She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk.

It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life.

Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George.

The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim. He was also unable to eat properly, and the tumour was affecting his ability to see.

His owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour which was sprouting from his head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105).

During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was delicately cut out."

Locals then took him to a butcher's shop where he was beaten, before his genitals were brutally chopped off with a meat cleaver.

The man is being treated in hospital, where his condition is described as critical.

A witness said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

But the police have called for those responsible to come forward.

A spokesman said: ""People cannot take the law into your own hands.

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.""

India has seen a spate of high profile violent attacks on women in recent years.

In 2012, a 23-year-old woman died after being attacked and gang-raped on a bus in Delhi in a case which sent shockwaves around the world.

The attack sparked a wave of protests across India.

In May, two young girls were found hanged from a tree in the state of Uttar Pradesh, amid reports they had been sexually assaulted.

1715,"A new piece of audio has emerged that allegedly is a recording of the exact moment when Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot unarmed teen Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Six shots can be heard in rapid succession, followed by a brief pause before four more shots are fired. 

According to the New York Daily News, the audio, which surfaced Monday, was recorded by a Ferguson, Mo., resident who can be heard on the tape talking with a woman when gunfire erupts in the background.

CNN aired the tape Monday but was unable to independently verify its authenticity. If the audio is from the exact moment when Brown was shot, then the gunfire heard on the tape clearly reveals that the officer paused before firing more shots. 

""That was what caught my attention initially,"" said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. ""It shows a point of contemplation.""

Witnesses have told both police and news stations that Brown, 18, was unarmed and running away with his hands up when Wilson began shooting. An independent autopsy indicates that Brown was hit at least six times, four in his arm and twice in the head.

The Daily News notes that if the audio is verified, the pause in firing could add weight to witnesses' claims."
1718,"Dan Olsen, a former-ish PGA Golfer, went on The Game 730 AM’s Mad Dog in the Morning on Friday, and lobbed some grenades at Tiger Woods.

“I’ve heard that he’s suspended,” said Olsen. “I’ve heard that he’s on a month suspension. And it’s kind of a strong witness. It’s a credible person that’s telling me this. It’s not testosterone but it’s something else. I think when it’s all said and done that he’s gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.”

Olsen also accused Woods of using shady golf balls, implied that there would be an institutional cover-up because the PGA needs to market Tiger, and insinuated that he’s faking his back injury. “His back’s not hurt,” Olsen said. “He was limping, and he was faking worse than I’ve ever seen him fake.”

ESPN obtained comment from the PGA, and Tiger Woods’ agent:

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen.  “There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,” Votaw said. “We categorically deny these allegations.”

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters. Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open. “Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world. These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,” said Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. “They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.”

“I’ll be looked at as just some crazy f— nobody making accusations about Tiger,” Olsen acknowledged to ESPN.

1720,"A South American nun suddenly started experiencing sharp pains, and not long after being rushed to the hospital, she gave birth to a baby boy. Now, the nun is claiming that she had no idea she was pregnant.

Reports say that the Catholic sister, originally from South America, belonged to an order in Macerata, Italy and had only arrived at the convent in June. Recently, after experiencing sudden sharp stomach pains, the sister was rushed to the hospital by her fellow nuns and was told she was pregnant. Soon after, she gave birth to a baby boy.



The baby is reportedly still in the hospital and will be undergoing some more testing to make sure that he is totally healthy. Reports say that the nun’s convent is considering taking care of the child."

1722,"Stories are coming out of Managua, Nicaragua, that a large bang was heard by residents there Saturday evening, and it registered on seismic detectors as well. A crater was found in the woods measuring something like 12 meters (40 feet) across. Claims are being made that this was a meteorite impact, a space rock a meter or so across slamming into the ground at high speed.

… but I’m unconvinced. Reports are still a bit sketchy, but my biggest doubts come in two parts:

1) In a city of over two million people, you’d expect a fireball around midnight would’ve been seen by a lot of people. I haven’t heard any confirmed reports of witnesses. Also, I haven’t seen any video from it either. The situation in Chelyabinsk in 2013 was different, of course, but video of that event showed up with an hour or two. I’d expect that after two days we’d have some visual evidence from Managua by now.

Note: I’ve already seen a video on YouTube claiming to be from the fireball, but it’s not; it’s a bright meteor that came in over Spain. Don’t be fooled by hoaxes! There are always lots of them when something like this happens. The picture at the top of this post appears in a lot of hoaxes; it was from a fireball over the Netherlands in 2009.

b) No meteorite has yet been found. If this was an impact, there should be debris in the crater, at the very least on a microscopic scale. I haven’t heard of any analysis of the soil there to look for fragments, either.

I am not saying this was not a meteorite impact. I am saying the evidence for this that I’ve seen so far leaves me pretty unconvinced. I’ll note this happened near an Air Force base, too, which again makes me a little more suspicious.

So my skeptic sense is tingling here, and won’t be assuaged until we get much better evidence than has been reported so far. I’ll add that some places are reporting that this may have been connected with asteroid 2014 RC, which passed by the Earth on Sunday. Although this was a near miss (2014 RC got less than 40,000 km from Earth) I am very, very doubtful of a connection. The asteroid passed at 18:00 UTC Sunday, which was noon Nicaragua time: 12 hours or so after whatever happened in Managua. It’s incredibly unlikely that a small piece of that asteroid was that far ahead of the main mass and still managed to hit us. The asteroid was moving at 40,000 kilometers per hour, so it was still farther away than the Moon when this event occurred.

Bottom line: This may or may not have been an impact from a meteorite. At the moment, based on what I’ve seen so far, I’d bet against it… but I’ve been wrong before. Until I see confirmed video or actual confirmed meteorite fragments I’ll remain doubtful."
1724,"LONDON — The Islamic State militant known as ""Jihadi John,"" who has been seen in videos of hostages being beheaded, has been named as Mohammed Emwazi by the BBC and The Washington Post.

The BBC said Emwazi, believed to be a Kuwaiti-born British man from west London, was known to British security services, who chose not to disclose his name for operational reasons.

Jihadi John has appeared in videos showing the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, U.S. medic Abdul-Rahman Kassig and Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

The black-clad, masked militant also appeared in a video last month with Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed.

The Washington Post said Emwazi, who comes from a well-to-do family, graduated from college with a degree in computer programming.

He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012, before joining the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, the paper reported.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group CAGE, which was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria, told the Washington Post he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John.

""There was an extremely strong resemblance,"" he said. ""This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

In a statement Commander Richard Walton, of Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

In September, FBI Director James Comey said U.S. officials believed they know the identify of Jihadi John, but did not release his name or nationality."
1725,"Partner goes global as bare-bummed mobile snaps of cheating pair without their clothes are shared across the planet

This is the moment the naked truth about a husband's cheating ways were exposed to the watching world.

Ting Su, 29, caught bed-hopping partner Cheng, 30, romping naked in an underground carpark along with her TWIN SISTER after using a mobile phone tracker to locate their whereabouts.

And when the wailing wife confronted the treacherous twosome about their red-hot rear-seat rendezvous, the stunned pair reacted by jumping out of the vehicle.

CEN   Bum deal: Ting's twin sister is left naked and embarrassed

Quick-thinking Ting seized her chance for instant karma and drove off – leaving the secret rompers bare-bummed and red-faced on the tarmac at a local shopping centre in the city of Suzhou, eastern China.

One witness said: ""It was so funny. Loads of people were grabbing their phones and I did as well. He was banging his fist on the window and shouting at her, and she just wasn't playing ball.""

Naij.com reported that It was later discovered that Cheng had been having an affair since Ting, who has now filed for divorce, gave birth to twins.

A woman who found out her boyfriend was cheating on her became an internet sensation when she scrawled abuse over his prized motor and posted photos of it online last month.

Stunned Maria Alejandra Samaniego, 25, went ballistic when she found cheating Pabil Muniz Quintanilla, 27, in bed with another woman at his home in Barranquilla, Colombia.

After storming out, she returned several hours later with a friend and convinced the security guard to let them into the garage area without letting Quintanilla know.

As pal Valeria Cazares Aranda, 28, filmed, Maria took a permanent black marker from her pocket and covered the gleaming white Mercedes with abuse, accusing him of being a ""c**p s***"", questioning the size of his manhood and being a 'junkie loser'.

1726,"We’ve all had jobs we absolutely can’t stand, and thanks to the Internet we’ve seen many examples of people quitting their jobs in amazing ways. A video popped up on YouTube today that appears to add yet another thread to this growing trend, as a “secret ending” to a not-at-all-popular smartphone game called Electric Boogie. The video shows a message from the game’s lead developer to his boss, and the language isn’t exactly kind.

“Working for you is a living hell,” the message reads. “You have your head so far up your ass, it’s no wonder why your breath always smells like shit. Consider this cartoon animation and this letter, my resignation from your pathetic company. I quit.” Adding “P.S. Your game fucking sucks.”

The note is signed “D.B.G 08/11/14” which would seem to credit it to a gameplay programmer named David Gordon, though Mr. Gordon’s name still appears on the website of developer TriplePlay Apps. If he did indeed quit in August, David Gordon is quite the trooper for remaining with the team a full four months later. (Or they're incredibly bad at updating the site.)

Then there’s the matter of the game’s marketing, which thus far has consisted of poorly conceived attempts at creating some viral buzz, all of which have fallen completely flat. For example, an Imgur gallery of horrible Electric Boogie parody movie posters had been submitted to several different subreddits before most of the links were eventually deleted.

The official YouTube account of TriplePlay Apps doesn’t seem to take the game itself too seriously either, intentionally slamming it as “terrible” and “the worst game ever.” This stands in stark contrast to the Electric Boogie page on the TriplePlay Apps website, where they praise the game. Why would the developers of the game trash it on YouTube? It’s all very strange and seems to suggest a desperation to create buzz, even in a so-bad-its-good way, though none of it ever caught on.

TriplePlay Apps itself is a bit of a mystery as well, as the company—if we can even call it that—has absolutely zero history of iOS apps of any kind, and very few on Google Play. In fact, Electric Boogie was published under the name Qbical LLC, which is also based out of Denton, Tex., the same city where TriplePlay Apps is supposedly located.

A Google search of any of the names associated with the company, from the CEO to the disgruntled David Gordon, returns absolutely nothing. Not a single Twitter account, Facebook page, or—and this is the best part—a single credible image on any website, including those associated with either of these “companies.”

In fact, I’m not even sure if TriplePlay Apps, Qbical LLC, or whatever you want to call the person or persons who published Electric Boogie even has an office at all. Qbical LLC is listed as a “Home Business” in a couple of smaller online business directories, with a single address. TriplePlay Apps uses this image on its website next to “Our Company”:

In the video he says he stumbled upon the game, began playing, and discovered this “secret ending,” but his YouTube history calls that into question. Not only did he view and “Like” the Electric Boogie trailer over a week before publishing his own video, he published a clip 10 months ago for a game called Flappy Beard. The video he published resides only on his account, so he presumably had some sort of involvement in the app or the creation of the video itself, and if you follow Flappy Beard back to the Google Play Store you’ll see that the app was published by—you guessed it—TriplePlay Apps.

1730,"The next MacBook Air will sport a twelve-inch screen, a thinner and smaller physical footprint, a cleaner chassis with one combined power connector and USB port, faster Broadwell chipsets from Intel, and it might even come in Space Grey. That’s the theory from Marc Gurman, and there’s no immediate reason to discount it.

Gurman and the 9to5Mac team have pulled together all the information, leaks, rumors, and speculation around a new Apple laptop, thrown in a dash of extrapolation, and put together a comprehensive prediction and artists impression of the new MacBook Air that should be available during the summer of 2015.

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.

This new MacBook Air will sport a twelve-inch screen, be physically smaller than the thirteen-inch MacBook Air, and could be narrower than the current svelte eleven inch MacBook Air. This will be accomplished by reducing the bezels around the screen and the keyboard, reducing the size and pitch of the keys, and repositioning the speakers.

9to5Mac also believe that Apple will ditch many of the ports and connectors around the chassis, leaving this MacBook Air with a headphone socket, a dual-pinhole microphone set-up, and a single USB-C port for power and cabled connectivity.

1731,"No one was hurt

A small meteorite struck a wooded area near the Nicaraguan capital’s airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang, and the crater left by the meteorite measured 40-feet wide and 16-feet, BBC reports. No one was hurt.

1732,"The New York Police Department, which has been arresting tens of thousands of people a year for low-level marijuana possession, is poised to stop making such arrests and to issue tickets instead, according to law enforcement officials.

People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.

The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the department’s excessive stop-and-frisk practices.

Curbing arrests for small-scale marijuana possession has become a cause for criminal justice reform advocates, and this year, the new Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, said he would stop prosecuting such cases. But his announcement did not go over well with Mr. de Blasio and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, who vowed to continue making low-level marijuana arrests.

Now, the de Blasio administration is publicly embracing the notion that such small-scale possession merits different treatment. And with the changes, City Hall is moving to retake control of a politically potent issue that has enormous resonance in the black and Latino communities, where a vast majority of small-scale marijuana arrests have taken place.

In the first eight months of the year, blacks and Hispanics represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city, according to a study written in part by Harry G. Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College who is a director of the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.

Many details of the changes planned by the de Blasio administration are still being discussed at City Hall, and many questions remain unanswered. Under the new policy, for example, will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued? Will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis? Other key questions, such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons, may not be up to City Hall.

A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the city’s five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorney’s offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.

In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayor’s plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.

Since July, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.

Continue reading the main story
Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.

“In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,” Mr. Thompson said. “By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”

Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the city’s lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.

Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were “put through the system,” meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.

In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Department’s crime-fighting strategies. During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.

In 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime. But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in “public view.” In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.

In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.

While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the department’s marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.

Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the department’s top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasio’s oversight of the police."

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, who works at the airport in the city of St Petersburg in north-western Russia said he had finished his shift and was going home when he remembered he had left his keys at work.

He said: “I returned back to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner. I know the rules and I know that it isn’t necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict, and security guards were just being heavy-handed.

“When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.”

Angry at officers demanding he remove the belt as requested, he had then stripped off everything in front of staff in St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport, and then walked through the scanner with just his socks on.

The speechless officers then did nothing and allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day it was to discover that the video from a security camera had somehow been leaked and had quickly gone viral online.

A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry’s transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said they were currently investigating the breach of security.

A spokesman said: “We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.”

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video. He said: “I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me but I will have the last laugh.”"

1735,"Twitter went crazy after a user claimed he spotted the 'Ant-Man' star in the footage

A shocking viral video of a drunk gay basher being tackled by travelers at the Dallas Fort-Worth International Airport grew a little more shocking with rumors that one of the citizen heroes was Paul Rudd.


But a rep for the actor tells The Hollywood Reporter that it isn't him.

Amateur Twitter sleuth Mark W. S. thought he spotted the Ant-Man star in the video, then questioned another Twitter user after she mentioned that she had spotted Rudd on her Dallas flight. 

""Weird question,"" Marks W.S. asked during his investigation. ""By chance was he wearing an olive sports coat and a blue check shirt?""

To which Twitter user MAbiga6 replies, ""Yes! And a blue hat, think it was a Yankees hat."" 

Comedian Sara Benincasa helped to popularize the theory on her Twitter feed, and Wonkette then ran a story positively identifying Rudd as the man in the video.

But the actor's publicist tells THR that Rudd was nowhere near the scene.

In the video, a drunk man grows increasingly belligerent at an airport gate as another traveler in a cowboy hat attempts to calm him down.

""He's queer! That's what I'm upset about,"" the drunk man says, gesturing to a third man in a pink shirt before hurling several more homophobic epithets.

The drunk man then lunges forward and kicks the man in the pink shirt. Three bystanders and a police officer immediately tackle the man to the ground. Once he is down, someone vaguely resembling Rudd makes sure the situation is sufficiently under control, then steps away from the scene."

Twitter users have been posting about the tearouts under the hashtags beardgate, seamgate and hairgate.

Last month after Apple reported record sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, users took to social media to discuss ""BendGate,"" the term used to describe the claims that iPhones may bend or become warped when carried in trouser pockets.

1739,"If you’ve seen a story floating around on your Facebook feed about Banksy getting arrested and exposed, don’t worry because Banksy is still anonymous and well. The hoax was the work of a “satirical” news site called The National Report — which I’m not linking because f*ck those guys — that makes up fake stories that sound like they could be ostensibly true, usually without a trace of actual satire, as filthy, filthy clickbait. It’s an awful yet unfortunately effective business model.

In a story which was published early this morning, The National Report claimed that Banksy was arrested in London by a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force and revealed to be a 35-year-old man named Paul Horner. The International Business Times did some quick fact checking and exposed the story to be a hoax:

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month – another hoax story that comes around every now and again – as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager’s house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include ‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month’ and ‘Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis’, has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

HAHA get it? It’s funny because it’s not true! I guess there’s some logic in there somewhere. It’s not even entertaining to see people share stories that come from places like the The National Report since they’re designed to trick — unlike when dumb people share stories from The Onion, which are designed to actually be satire. Again, and I cannot stress this enough: F*ck those guys."

Sick ISIS militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son - after telling her it was cooked meat and rice.

The worried mum had bravely visited the terror group's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one who had been captured and taken prisoner by Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq.

ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, after giving the mother cooked meat, rice and soup, she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son.

There have been a number of real-life Hannibal Lecters who murder their victims in order to eat their flesh.

But there have also been people who have eaten human meat by accident such as David Scheiding who unwittingly ate some of a fast food employee's finger which had found its way into his chicken burger.

More sinister are those who have been forced to eat their own flesh or another's as part of a sadistic attack.

From an Irish gang who made their victim eat his own ear, to a mum who forced her sons to eat their own flesh.

Two sick attackers in Russia murdered a man before eating him and then selling the rest of his flesh to a kebab shop.

While alongside a range of disgusting crimes, warlord Joseph Kony forced a group of women to eat their own noses before returning them to their families as a warning to the community not to fight against him.

1. The Irishman who was forced to eat his own ear

Traumatised: Brendan Higginbotham was forced to eat his own ear after being attacked by a gang in Ireland

A man in Ireland was forced to eat his own ear by a gang who attacked him in 2011.

Brendan Higginbotham needed plastic surgery to repair horrific injuries inflicted on him by thugs in Newbridge, Co Kildare.

He was attacked by a gang in the town where he was dragged down a lane and then beaten with a hammer and a metal bar.

He was injured on his head, jaw and leg, as well as losing part of his ear.

A police spokesman John Joe O'Connell said at the time: ""Part of this man's ear was cut off and he was actually forced to eat it.""

Higginbotham was too traumatised to describe the incident in detail and said he wasn't going to press charges.

He said: ""I just want to recover and get back to keeping myself busy, I'm glad I'm alive.""

2. The pair who killed and ate their victim before selling him to a kebab van

Rex   Disgusting: Two men admitted killing and eating their victim before selling the meat to a Russian kebab stall

The killers were tracked down after police found human remains on the outskirts of the Russian town of Perm.

Two men confessed to stabbing the victim and then beating him with a hammer.

They then cut up his body and ate part of it, before selling some of it to a kiosk that sold doner kebabs and pies.

Investigators who searched the kiosk found no trace of the human remains.

Investigator Sergei Molchanov said: ""The meat had already been either cooked or sold.""

3. The Mum who helped to torture her own children

CEN   Sickening: Cannibal cult mum Klara Mauerova

Klara Mauerova, 31 and her sister Katerina led the sickening torture of her eight-year-old son Ondrej and his ten year-old brother Jakub.

She tortured her son in a locked cellar while relatives skinned him and forced him to eat his own flesh.

During the court case the two boys had told judges how their mother and relatives had stubbed cigarettes out on their bare skin, whipped them with belts, and tried to drown them.

They were also sexually abused and forced to cut themselves with knives.

The terrified youngsters said they were kept in cages or handcuffed to tables and made to stand in their own urine for days.

Klara, from the Czech Republic was jailed for ten years for her role in the sick torture.

She and her sister, both members of religious cult the Grail Movement, had refused to explain why they had tortured the boys.

4. The finger in the burger

Disgusting: A diner at Arby's unwittingly ate some of the manager's finger

In a genuine accident one fast food fan was sickened when part of the manager's finger ended up in his lunch.

David Scheiding sued the owners of fast food company Arby's after he bit into a burger and tasted the strange meat.

""It looked like I was seeing fingerprints on it,"" he said. ""I got sick and went to the bathroom.""

Health investigators talked to the restaurant manager, who had a bandage on his right thumb and wore a latex glove, according to a health district report.

The manager said he sliced skin from the thumb while shredding lettuce, and sanitized the area but didn't throw away the bin of lettuce, the report said.

Scheiding's sandwich contained lettuce.

5. The tyrant who forced women to eat their own noses

Reuters   Terrifying: One of the world's most wanted rebel chiefs, Joseph Kony of the Lord's Resistance Army

Notorious Joseph Kony, chief of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, has been responsible for a long list of horrific crimes including ordering the rape of captured women on a massive scale and kidnapping children who are forced to kill or be killed.

One particularly disgusting attack was meted out on a group of women Kony wanted to make an example of.

A woman called Laweel was told that she and 10 others were to be mutilated, and sent home alive as a warning to others not to join the fight against Kony's

They were lined up and kidnapped children were told to sharpen the knives and machetes laid there, and one by one the women had their noses, lips and ears cut off.

They were then made to eat their own flesh."
1744,"A disturbing video posted online appears to show the beheading of American journalist James Foley, who was kidnapped while covering the Syrian conflict in 2012.

In the video a man who appears to be Foley, dressed in orange, kneels beside an armed man clad in black. Foley delivers a statement condemning U.S. action in Iraq and says that the U.S. government is his “real killers.”

“For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” Foley says in halting speech. “I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope of freedom of seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.”

Seconds later, the figure dressed in black brandishes a knife and identifies himself as with the Islamic State, the name the brutal terror group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria took on after its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared himself the leader of all Muslims.

“Today your military air force has attacked us daily… Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims,” the figure in black says. He then addresses President Obama directly, saying “any attempt… to deny the Muslims their right to live in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.”

Foley is then killed. The video continues, showing American Steven Sotloff, who has written for national publications like Time, also dressed in orange and on his knees.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the figure in black says.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the U.S. intelligence community ""is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.""

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" spokesperson Caitlin Hayden wrote in a statement to reporters.

The U.S. government offers a $10 million reward for information leading to ISIS leader al-Baghdadi’s capture.

Foley was on assignment in Syria for the news outlet GlobalPost. The news organization's co-founder Charles Sennott said today there is ""no reliable proof that this execution is authentic"" and that they're working to gather information.

""If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,"" Sennott said. ""He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.""

In an interview with The Boston Globe in 2011, Foley spoke about being held captive while covering the uprising in Libya and the importance of his job.

“I believe that frontline journalism is important,” Foley said. “Without these photos and videos and firsthand experience, we really can’t tell the world how bad it might be.”

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., had worked with Foley's family and the State Department in their efforts to get Foley back.

""If confirmed, this barbarous and heinous act shocks the conscience and underscores the truly evil nature of the terrorists we confront, who must be defeated,"" Ayotte said in a statement."
1745,"Digital retail company Amazon announced Thursday it plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for holiday shopping season.

The company's first physical location will function as more of a warehouse than a big-box store. The location will have a limited supply of items available for same-day delivery in the city, and will process returns, exchanges, and pickup orders, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon did not immediately say how long the experimental store would remain open, nor whether it was preparing to open similar physical locations elsewhere in the country.

1746,"Aaron Sorkin's upcoming film about former Apple CEO Steve Jobs has reportedly found its Steve Wozniak: Seth Rogen.

The news, first reported by Variety on Thursday, comes just one week after Sorkin confirmed that Christian Bale will portray Jobs in the Sony Pictures film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late tech luminary.

Sony did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment about the casting report, but Rogen is no stranger to working with Sony. He previously starred in the studio's This Is the End last year and will star in The Interview in December.

This is the seventh film Sorkin has written, including The Social Network in 2010. It will be told in three sequences focusing on Apple's launches of the iPod, NeXT and the Macintosh.

The movie — like Open Roads' Jobs flick starring Ashton Kutcher as as the titular character and Josh Gad as Wozniak did — will explore Jobs' life, particularly his relationships.

""It’s not a biopic; it’s not the story of Steve Jobs — it’s something much different than that,"" Sorkin said in April. ""He’s a fascinating guy — part hero, part antihero... He’s a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life.""

Steve Jobs passed away on Oct. 5, 2011. Sorkin confirmed this year that he finished the film's script.

""It will be up to the audience whether it’s good or not,"" Sorkin said. ""But Steve Jobs is one of the very few times I ended up writing what I set out to write. It’s an incredibly satisfying feeling.""

Wozniak was critical of Gad's portrayal (""personalities are very wrong although mine is closer""), so it will be fascinating to see what he has to say about Rogen.

Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh to the world. Computing would never be the same.

Ridley Scott's famous ""1984"" commercial for the original Macintosh continues to find imitators, even today. In 2011, Motorola attempted to spoof the classic ad in a promotional spot for its Xoom tablet.

When Bill Gates appeared on-screen at Macworld Boston in 1997, the audience reacted with boos and hisses. Still, the decision to partner with Microsoft and have Microsoft commit to producing software for the Macintosh was one of the most shrewd -- and likely one of the most intelligent -- decisions that Jobs made upon his return to Apple.

Although many incorrectly believe that Microsoft ""bought"" Apple in 1997, the reality is, without Microsoft's investment and commitment to developing Macintosh software, the company may have had a more difficult time getting its next line of products to the market.

The iMac helped set the standard for the modern Apple even as we know it today. Designed by Jonathan Ive, the iMac was sleek, modern and affordable. This was not the Macintosh of the early to mid 1990s, it was something new.

With the iMac, Apple became cool. We can vividly remember looking at the egg-shaped all-in-one design with the hockey puck mouse and famous lack of a floppy drive and being transfixed. The iMac marked the beginning of Apple 2.0.

Nearly 10 years ago, Apple debuted the iPod. Famously ridiculed and dismissed by Slashdot, it would be several years before the device would become iconic, and in the process, change Apple fundamentally as a company.

The premise behind the iPod was simple: 1,000 songs in your pocket. Its the execution that set the device apart from everyone else.

In 2003, Apple flipped the switch again, with the launch of the iTunes Music Store. In a post-Napster industry, most were skeptical that iTunes could drive music sales. Eight years later, iTunes is the number one music retailer by a large margin.

Ten years on, the iPod is getting long in the tooth, but it still remains the leader in its product category.

After the iPod started to achieve massive success in 2003 and 2004, the rumors of an iPod phone started to swirl.

The first attempt to bring a product like that to the market was in the form of Motorola's Rokr. The Rokr tried to capitalize on the success of the Razr, while also adding compatibility with iTunes.

Still, the device was a dud. You can see Steve Jobs's frustration with the device in this demonstration. The Rokr was an example that only Apple could build an Apple product.

Steve Jobs's commencement speech at Stanford University in 2006 is one of our favorite Jobs moments. It's riveting, inspirational and every bit as good as any Apple product keynote.

All hail the Jesus Phone. The iPhone changed the mobile industry. Full stop. The mobile world and ecosystem that we know today would not exist in the same way that it does now without the iPhone.

The iPhone also changed Apple as a company and helped further cement Jobs's place in history.

Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most powerful and influential men of our times. Seeing them together at D5, just ahead of the iPhone's U.S. launch, was amazing.

In January 2010, Apple changed the game again with the iPad. Like the iPod and iPhone, the critics dismissed it and predicted its failure. Its success has outpaced nearly every other technology product launch in history and is having a seismic impact on education, publishing, media consumption and computing in general.

The PC era might not be over, but I'm willing to bet that the computer I use every day in 10 years will have a lot more in common with the iPad than the MacBook Pro."

We thank Jim for all the joy he gave us. He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person. Please respect our privacy in the days ahead as we mourn and cherish Jim."
1750,"In designing its first wearable device in the Apple Watch, Apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device, but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles.

According to The Wall Street Journal, sources claim Apple Watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in April. Specifically, Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool, one capable of measuring a user's blood pressure, heart rate, stress level and more, said people familiar with the matter.

The publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands, Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor, the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package, Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android.

Aside from catchall smartwatch devices, a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products — usually wrist-worn — from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example, the W/Me band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels, while the latest products from Fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring.

Apple started development of its Watch four years ago, with an eye on health and fitness, but the project was quickly dubbed a ""black hole"" for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apple's rigorous standards, sources said.

For example, skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs, but later testing showed actual results varied person to person, with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features, but results were inconsistent.

Apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs, as evidenced by recently discovered job postings, but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness, the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory, iOS compatible smartwatch, iPhone companion and daily communicator, among others.

Apple Watch does, however, sport a few Apple-only features, including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year."
1751,"In case you hadn’t heard, a little movie called Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is currently filming in and around Detroit, MI. Since we live in the Golden Age of social media networking, set pictures and videos have fueled all kinds of speculation on what’s going on in this movie, from Ben Affleck’s shoulder injury to Jesse Eisenberg’s hair to Scoot McNairy’s legs.
The most recent set leaks revolved around Batman’s ride. Instagram users posted several pictures of the new, updated Batmobile, which was promptly followed by an official photo released by director Zack Snyder. The exciting design appears to be something of a hybrid between the tank-like vehicle used in Christopher Nolan’s Bat-films and more traditional, hot rod-inspired Batmobiles of old.

Meanwhile, outlets like Bleeding Cool reported a rumor that one of the Batmobiles from the movie’s set had been stolen. The rumor was picked up by some of the mainstream media (such as the local Detroit CBS affiliate) before being debunked by the Detroit Free Press.

In response, director Zack Snyder took to Twitter (as he does) to send up not only the stolen-Batmobile rumor, but to reference a competing franchise. Snyder tweeted the following picture:
Is Snyder taking a sly, friendly dig at J.J. Abrams and the currently-filming Star Wars: Episode VII? It would seem so, but what if Snyder had used, say, a Joker or Two-Face lookalike – or at least one of their henchmen? The internet would’ve imploded. This way, Snyder provides fans with a harmless bit of franchise-crossover in the form of this officially-sanctioned bit of fan-fiction. The attention to detail is pretty funny, too – the way the Gotham PD cop nearest the Batmobile is looking at the Stormtrooper’s blaster is priceless.

Make no mistake, Zack Snyder is following the online fan chatter. He’s not above calling in to a Detroit radio show to defend Aquaman’s badassery and, apparently, will comment on your Instagram video when the mood takes him.

CBM caught Snyder’s now-deleted comment - “Watching you” - on the following video taken by IG user @danielblane, who was home one night while the Batmobile did burnouts on the neighboring Batman v Superman set:
Snyder, whose Instagram handle is @cruelfilms, has removed his comment, but judging by the reaction of the video’s other commenters, the fact that Snyder has weighed in at all delights them to no end.

The fact that the director takes the time to interact with his fans is genuinely heartening for audience members who may have questioned the decision to hand Snyder not just an all-new Superman and Batman, but Warner Bros. and DC’s own interconnected movie universe.

The leaked BvS set pictures and videos still don’t answer any of the bigger questions about the film’s plot and whether or not it will be able to seamlessly integrate multiple superheroes while giving us a satisfying first-time team-up of the World’s Finest, but that won’t stop us from poring over every image from Detroit that we can get our hands on.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will open in theaters on March 25, 2016.

1752,"Macaulay Culkin has been killed off again – in yet another internet hoax.

Back in April rumours surfaced that the troubled star had been found dead. Just seven months later it’s gone and happened again.

Some not funny dudes thought it would be really funny to set up a Facebook page reportedly called Rip Macaulay Culkin and post a message claiming the star had died. He hasn’t, by the way.

Oh LOL.

The group gained thousands of likes and although has since been removed, the news is still doing the rounds on social networks.

The original post is alleged to have said:

‘At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.’

Reports said that he’d been found dead in his Manhattan appartment.

In truth, he’s alive and well and probably not particularly amused that some hoaxer is claiming he’s anything but.

Naturally the internet is not happy at this turn of events:

1756,"KIM Jong-un could try and open a restaurant in Scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup, North Korea experts claim.

This comes after the controversial leader brought his chain, The 'Pyongyang' restaurants, over to Europe by launching one in Holland.

Now North Korea watchers believe Scotland may be the next prime location, largely thanks to the popularity of whisky among the communist ruling elite.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

He added: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts.

GettyKim Jong-Un  
""Despite voting No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The chain has begun springing up across China and Asia, with proceeds funnelled back to North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Would you eat at Kim Jong-un's restaurant?

YES
NO
 
Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, said: ""They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

""They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

""But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won't get a plateful of dog!""

ReutersKim Jong Un looking at fast food  
Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months.

She said: ""North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.""

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30% of takings back to Pyongyang. But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-un's own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, portly leader Jong-un is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

It's claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished.

The FBI recently accused North Korea of being behind cyber attacks on the US. The regime is thought to be incensed at a film, The Interview, which centres around the fictional assassination of Kim Jong-un.

Lunchtime: it’s that essential break in the day when you get to catch up with friends, check your feeds, eat some crappy lunch line food and, oh, if you’re 17-year-old Mohammed “Teen Wolf” Islam, allegedly rake in $72 million playing the stock market.

New York magazine reported that the Queens, New York, teen made millions of dollars during his lunch breaks, which he used to buy a new BMW (which he can’t drive yet because he doesn’t have a license right now) and rent an apartment in the city. And though his parents won’t let him move out of their house just yet, the president of Stuyvesant High School’s Investment Club seems set for life before he even walks at graduation.

The quiet son of Bengali immigrants has been profiled in his school paper and landed on a list of young money hustlers to watch in the Business Insider. When New York recently caught up with him and pal Damir Tulemaganbetov, the pair chowed down on caviar and green drinks as revealed that they were weighing an offer from a “hedge fund guy” who they said wanted to give them $150 million to invest.

Now, along with two friends, Mohammed plans to launch his own hedge fund in June, when he turns 18 and can officially get his broker-dealer license. The trio also plan to go to college next year, but they’re not worried about Psych 101 getting in the way of their ultimate goal: $1 billion. “By next year!” said pal Damir Tulemaganbetov. “But it’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …”

Damir likened Mohammed to “Wolf of Wall Street” anti-hero Jordan Belfort, who, coincidentally, also got his start in penny stocks. After a cousin showed Mohammed how to trade the stocks, the teen got hooked on it, but got spooked after losing a bunch of money he’d made tutoring… as a 9 year-old.

“I had been paralyzed by my loss,” said Mohammed, who went on to study hedge fund managers and try to learn their secrets. He graduated to trading oil and gold and while he wouldn’t confirm the widely reported $72 million figure, Islam said his net worth is in the “high eight figures.”

“It all comes down to this,” he said. “What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”"

1771,"According to supply chain rumors, a Samsung processor will power the Apple Watch.

The Apple Watch - which is expected to land later this year - is Apple's newest class of device and will integrate closely with the iPhone, and allegedly be powered by a Samsung chip manufactured using the company's 28-nanometer process.

Samsung used to manufacture chips for the iPhone or iPad, but it was replaced by TSMC. Apple allegedly switched suppliers because TSMC could produce processors using the smaller 20-namometer manufacturing process. The smaller the manufacturing process, the smaller the chips and the less energy they consume.

The rumor is that Apple has ordered 3,000 to 4,000 12-inch wafers monthly. Each wafer can supply several hundred processors.

One question that remains is why Apple would choose a Samsung chip built using a 28-nanometer process over a smaller, more efficient 20-nanometer chip from TSMC. Perhaps it comes down to price, or it could be that TSMC is already stretched supplying chips for iPhones and iPads. Or maybe the report is inaccurate.

How many Apple Watch units that Apple expects to shift over the course of the year is unknown, although some analysts have suggested that the figure could be around the 10 million mark."
1772,"Amazon may be venturing beyond the world of online retail to set up its first brick-and-mortar shop, according to a report from Bloomberg News.

The store will be in Seattle and its focus will be pricier merchandise such as tablet computers, the report says. And its footprint won’t be nearly as large as that of big box retailers such as Barnes & Noble.

The single store is a test run for Amazon to see whether a chain of retail outlets could be profitable. If so, it could be a way for the company to make up for the declines they’ve seen in profits due to the manufacturing costs of the Kindle Fire.

The blog Good E Reader reports that Amazon has hired a designer to begin work on the store’s look and layout and that it is aiming to open its doors later this year in time for the holiday shopping season.

There would be certain advantages to Amazon having retail stores — namely that some items could be picked up immediately instead of going through shipping once they were purchased online.

Over at Forbes, Eric Savitz notes that this isn’t the first time that there have been rumors about Amazon opening a chain of stores — in 2009 similar rumors surfaced after the Sunday Times reported the online retailer was looking at properties. Amazon quickly refuted the report.

According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves. The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor did they provide any proof of it.

The ISIS claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main lines of battle between Kurds and ISIS are in the Syrian-Turkish border town of Kobani – but Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicorel expressed doubt over the ISIS report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenberg's capture are probably ISIS propaganda.

The Shin Bet, Israel's general security service, told The Jerusalem Post that ""there are no further details at this stage.""

Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to ""someone else"" and would be without internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.

If the websites' reports are true, Rosenberg would likely be the first Western female to fall into ISIS captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.

Unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, which refused to negotiate with ISIS over their captured nationals, thus giving the impression of laissez faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.

This does not mean that Israel would negotiate with ISIS over Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured – or that ISIS would agree to talk Israel, chalking her nationality up to Canadian alone.

It is worth mentioning that if Rosenberg was captured, she would be the second Israeli – of dual nationality – in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report from the Syrian Civil War, was captured by ISIS last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.

It is also worth noting that Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter. No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces – whether safe or in ISIS captivity – there is no doubt that upon return to Israel, she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arab who joined ISIS and returned.

This is not Rosenberg's first tryst with adventurism – in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is however, her first serious choice encounter with death.

Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, Canada, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Ma’ariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and make aliya in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.

Rosenberg said that she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterward had money problems.

She met an American friend in ulpan (Hebrew language school) who led her into crime, she claimed. She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, and perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.

After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail."

“I have no idea [if it's authentic],” Klinger said. “I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. …I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN.”

“When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax,” Fuetnes said, explaining:

“The engineers in the laboratory at Quantico will be trying to determine if there was a dubbing; did we have an original recording of this guy having a conversation no one wants to talk about, and then the shots then dubbed over it; was it the complete tape? All accounts from Brown’s side and the officer’s side say there was a single shot fired initially at the door of the police car. So that shot, followed by Brown trying to flee, and then the officer exiting the car and pursuing him and then firing the series of shots — so we’re missing that first shot. Now, I don’t know, CNN got this tape first. Did they censor it because the guy said something obscene over the first shot and they didn’t want to air that? We just don’t know all that.”

New Day cohost Michaela Pereira defended the airing of the tape. “It needs to be said the lawyer who is representing the man who gave us the audio gave it to us, she swears it is real,” Pereira said. “We have no reason here at CNN to believe that it’s not true.”

1777,"An article saying McDonald’s is removing the Big Mac, Apple Pies, and large size options isn’t real.

It was published on Daily Buzz Live, a fake news website.

According to a disclaimer, “Most are inspired by real news events, And just a few stories are works of complete fiction. Those few articles are for entertainment purposes only. The articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways. Therefore, just a few articles contained on this website Daily Buzz Live are works of fiction. Any truth or actual facts contained in those stories or posts are purely incidental or coincidental and not intended to be, or be construed as, facts.”

So while some of the articles are “real news,” this article about McDonald’s is fake.

Tens of thousands of people on Facebook shared the bogus article as of Sunday.

Here’s what the bogus article reads:

McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.”

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination."
1778,"The New York Post decided that it was a good idea to report that members of ISIS may have been infected with Ebola. In other news, Andy Borowitz has been hired at the New York Post. (Haha, no, kidding. Can you imagine, though?)

Apparently, the World Health Organization is investigating claims made by Iraqi newspaper Al-Sabah that Ebola and HIV-AIDS are spreading among residents of Mosul, brought there by ""terrorists and expats from different countries, especially Africa."" Mosul is held by ISIS; Al-Sabah is the official Iraqi government newspaper.

Mashable reports that the story, which originated in Al-Sabah, has spread amongst other pro-government and Kurdish newspapers. Like a virus! Might such outlets have an interest in encouraging the notion that ISIS fighters were stricken with highly-stigmatized diseases? Hmm.

Meanwhile, Forbes reported in October that ISIS maybe possibly could use Ebola as a weapon:

So maybe that ridiculous scenario is coming to pass. Maybe! Maybe. There's just no way for us to know for sure. Then again, ""We've seen no specific credible intelligence that [ISIS] is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in October.

Oh, and also, according to Iraq's Ministry of Health, there are no doctors in Mosul that have the capacity to diagnose Ebola. The reports are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded,"" a ministry spokesman said.

1780,"The true identity of the ISIS terrorist known as ""Jihadi John,"" who has appeared in several videos showing the beheading of hostages, reportedly has been revealed.

The Washington Post first reported Thursday, citing friends and human rights workers familiar with the case, that the man's real name is Mohammed Emwazi, a west London man who had been detained by counterterror officials in Britain at least once, in 2010. The paper also reported that Emwazi was born in Kuwait, is from a well-to-do family, graduated from college with a degree in computer programming and is thought to have traveled to Syria sometime in or around 2012.

The BBC reported that British intelligence had previously identified the man, but had chosen not to disclose his name for operational reasons.

Commander Richard Walton of the London Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command released a statement saying, ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk. We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The masked and hooded terrorist achieved instant notoriety when he appeared in a video released by ISIS last August that showed the beheading of American journalist James Foley. At the time, many commentators and analysts remarked on the man's distinct London accent.

The man is believed to have appeared in other videos that showed the beheading of other hostages, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig, known as Abdul-Rahman after his apparent conversion to Islam in captivity.

The man's most recent appearance came last month in a video with Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa. Both men also were killed by the terror group.

The terrorist was given the nickname ""Jihadi John"" after interviews with former ISIS hostages revealed him to be part of a group of British jihadists who guarded the hostages and were dubbed ""The Beatles.""

The BBC reported that Emwazi is believed to be an associate of a known terror suspect who traveled to Somalia in 2006, and is allegedly linked to a funding network for the Somali-based militant group Al Shabaab.

1781,"He’s the teen wolf of Wall Street.

A kid from Queens has made tens of millions of dollars — by trading stocks on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School, New York magazine reports in its Monday issue.

Mohammed Islam is only 17 and still months away from graduating — but worth a rumored $72 million. “The high eight figures,” is as specific as the shy and modest teen would get when asked his net worth.

Islam bought himself a BMW but doesn’t have a license to drive it. And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won’t let him move out of the house yet.

Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.

“What makes the world go round?” Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. “Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

Islam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.

They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.

“Mo’s our maestro,” one of the kids explained.

The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. “But it’s not just about the money,” Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.

“Like the Koch brothers,” he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.

Islam’s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said.

Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.

“But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,” he said.

And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate’s Greenwich mansion, he’s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him “who I am today.”

“Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ”"
1784,"A photo of a woman sitting in front of what appear to be dozens of iPhone 5Cs has gone viral in China. While few details about the photo’s origins are available, media have speculated she works at a Chinese App Store ranking manipulation farm. Her job is to download, install, and uninstall specific apps over and over again to boost their App Store rankings.

The table she’s working at seems to be specially designed for this purpose, and there’s another one across from her in the background.

Accompanying the photo on some sites is a screenshot displaying the supposed prices for this service. To get into the top 10 free apps costs RMB 70,000 (US$11,200), and keeping it there will run you another RMB 405,000 (US$65,000) per week. The third column is the monthly fare, and negotiations take place over popular messaging service QQ.

app store manipulation prices

The original photo was tweeted on Weibo with the caption, ""Hard-working App Store ranking manipulation employee.""

Apple tries to prevent PC-based iPhone emulation programs (bots) made for this purpose and bans apps that use them, so manual labor is the best way to ensure the closest simulation of actual users.

A search for ""app store ranking manipulation"" (刷榜 app store) on Taobao, China’s most popular C2C ecommerce site, reveals dozens upon dozens of vendors selling similar services. Their prices are listed as one yuan, but it’s more likely that the real negotiations take place through direct chat.

For the record, we want to reiterate that this is just a viral photo. We do not know when, where, or by whom it was taken, and cannot confirm this is actually a ranking manipulation farm.

1785,"Posting photos of a guntoting child online, Islamic State supporters announced that the group's youngest soldier has died in combat.

Twitter accounts linked to the jihadist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed that the child soldier ""got martyred"" with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.

Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.

The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors Islamic State social media for the Londonbased Quilliam counter-extremism think-tank.

In the past week, Cooper has noticed the hashtag ""shibal-alBaghdadi"" - which translates as ""the cub of Baghdadi"" - on Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State group.

While the fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph.

Cooper first saw Islamic State supporters tweeting that the young boy had died on Sept. 26.

And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make the militant group seem ""more brutal than it is,"" the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from Islamic State. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. airstrike, though that has not been confirmed.

The militant group's supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.

""It seems like a very legitimate thing,"" Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that Islamic State is known to use child soldiers. ""I would vouch for it.""

A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for the group, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said the militant group's child soldiers are as young 12 and 13 years old.

Children are also frequently used in Islamic State propaganda, with photos showing children in ""uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,"" the UN reported.

""Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by (Islamic State),"" said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.

""If we (Canada) send boots on the ground, we're going to see this face to face,"" she said.

Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to airstrikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground."
1786,"A British man who went to fight against Islamic State in Iraq has said a mother was made to eat her own son after he was kidnapped and murdered by the group.

Yasir Abdulla claimed that an elderly Kurdish woman went to Mosul, a city captured by Isis, and demanded to see him.

But he said she was fed his body.

Mr Abdulla, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, told The Sun: ‘She was determined to find her son and went to Isis headquarters and asked to see him.

‘The Isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.’

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

Mr Abdulla decided to go to Iraq after discovering that Isis had come within six miles of his home village in Kurdistan.

He said that Isis was threatening to kidnap and bury people alive unless they surrendered.

He has now returned to Yorkshire, but hopes to return to fight the terror group."
1787,"While local reports revealed Wednesday that the Jordanian King Abdullah will authorize airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, a U.S. official described the Arab monarch as citing a Hollywood movie character when expressing his wrath upon hearing that the militants had burned his countryman pilot alive during his captivity.

“He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie,” Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, told Fox News Channel in an interview aired Wednesday.

King Abdullah had to cut his U.S. trip short after hearing the news that Moaz al-Kasasbeh was burned alive.

During a private session with members of the House Armed Services Committee lawmakers, the king expressed his anger by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen,” said the Marine Corps veteran.

However, Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution.

“He’s angry,” Hunter said of King Abdullah. “They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘The only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

“He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Hunter also said that the lawmakers and King Abdullah did not make any mention of U.S. President Barack Obama. 
He added: “ISIS is now going to regret this … because King Abdullah is not Barack Obama.”

The Jordan Times reported that thousands of Jordanians gathered on Wednesday to receive King Abdullah.

The Jordan times also reported that mosques and churches around the Kingdom held prayers on Wednesday in memory of al-Kasasbeh.

King not flying missions
Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets - indicated he is set to do so.

The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force.

The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

1788,"Before Apple unveiled the Apple Watch last September, reports indicated the device would come with 10 sensors to track health and fitness data, leading some healthcare professionals to find the unveiled Apple Watch's health features disappointing. In a new report, The Wall Street Journal offers a look at the original Apple Watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems.

Apple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It’s not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a “black hole” sucking in resources, one of these people said.The Apple Watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user's blood. However, a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused Apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product.

The skin conductivity features didn't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin, while results varied depending on how tight an Apple Watch was worn on users' wrists. Additionally, if Apple decided to use the health data to provide ""health or behavioral advice"", the Cupertino company would have to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators.

While these features were dropped for the first version of the Apple Watch, sources tell the WSJ that they could appear in future versions of the device, echoing a Reuters report from September.

Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's objective with Apple Watch is to ""change the way people live their lives"" and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do, which includes activity monitoring, reminding users to stand up after a certain time period, and non-verbal communication with friends. Apple is currently asking developers to have their Apple Watch apps ready by mid-February, with some developers traveling to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for help.

Cook has confirmed the Apple Watch will launch in April. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch.

1789,"Chinese people have been given state advice on the adoption of English sounding names – being urged to avoid those that make them sound like a “stripper” and instead opt for ones that imply the bearer is from “a fancy or conservative family”.

A report published on the website of CCTV, a state broadcaster, offered readers practical advice on the selection of their Western-style name, a rite of passage for most young Chinese.

“Take heed,” the article said. “English names come with different connotations…A name can come with a 'feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are.”

Names “with a distinct feeling of Britishness” such as Elizabeth, William and Catherine were considered as “safe” by the article, which was illustrated with a picture of the Royal family.

But other, less desirable name types were also listed, such as those derived from “suggestive” foods such as Candy, Lolly and Sugar which were “typically thought of as 'non-smart girl’ names, or 'stripper’ names.”

Picking the distinctive name of a world leader of celebrity such as Obama or Madonna, or that of a religious figure (“Satan”), was not advised.

In a discussion about the article on Observer, a news portal, one user suggested that the tradition could be short-lived. “Why get an English name?” Xiao Weixia wrote. “Just wait, everyone will get a Chinese name in the future.”"
1790,"(Reuters) - A mysterious late-night blast in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua that left a crater 12 meters (40 feet) wide was most likely caused by a meteorite, government scientists said on Sunday.

The loud explosion occurred around 11 p.m. on Saturday on the outskirts of Managua near the airport, said Wilfried Strauch from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter) in an interview on a government TV channel. No one was injured.

Strauch said that Nicaragua is asking the United States for expert help to investigate the event, which was picked up by seismic sensors.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" said Jose Millan, also from Ineter.

""Firstly, we have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact.""

Strauch said they had not been able to determine the composition of the supposed meteorite as they were not sure whether it had disintegrated on hitting ground or if it remained buried.

""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population,"" Millan said.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

Shane Smith has enough money to keep him in steak and wine for the rest of his life
Who is he?

Shane Smith is the CEO of Vice Media, the youth media company and digital content creation studio.


What’s he buying?

During a recent trip to Las Vegas, Smith paid $300,000 for dinner at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse.

$300,000? On a steak?

It wasn’t just one steak. He paid the bill for the entire dinner party. According to Bloomberg, accounts vary on the exact number, but it’s estimated that there were between 12 and 25 people at the dinner table.

How much do these steaks cost?

The Prime Steakhouse’s most expensive steak – the 28oz bone-in rib eye – comes in at $85. They’re unlikely to have made much of a dent in the price. The lion’s share of the cost probably went on wine, which, the FT reports, cost $15,000 a bottle.

The Las Vegas meal is not the only big spend from Mr Smith in recent times. According to Gawker, at Vice’s 2014 Christmas party, Smith gave $1m to Vice employees as “stocking stuffers”.

How does he afford all of this?

On the night of the steak meal, Mr Smith had reportedly won $100,000 in a game of blackjack earlier in the evening. But even without that, he’s not exactly short of cash. Vice has been growing in the last few years – receiving investments worth $500m last year alone ($250m each from Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks).

Smith claims to be worth over $1bn. But in 2013, Forbes estimated that it was closer to $400m. It’s still enough to keep him in steak and wine for the rest of his life though.

As Smith told Forbes, “At this point, I don’t give a sh** about money. I’m worth more money than I can ever spend”."
1794,"Former “NBC Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw wants his replacement Brian Williams fired, the New York Post’s Page Six reported Thursday night, citing sources.

“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” an NBC source told Page Six. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”

Williams, on Wednesday, recanted a 2003 war story in which he claimed that he was aboard a helicopter in Iraq that was forced down because of RPG fire. The story, which had been repeated throughout the years, had been recently challenged on social media.

An NBC source told Page Six that Brokaw and former NBC News president Steve Capus “knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it.”

Nevertheless, a network source told the newspaper that the network is firmly behind Williams.

“He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,” a network source told Page Six.

1795,"CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) — Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico have yet to find any of 43 teachers college students who disappeared after a confrontation with police, security officials said Tuesday.

None were among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the Sept. 26 attack, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of 10th mass grave Tuesday.

Relatives of missing students march with flowers and candles to protest the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college in Chilpancingo, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 14, 2014. According to Mexico's attorney general none of the missing students were among the bodies found in the first set of mass graves outside the town. Authorities have said police involved in ""disappearing"" the students were working in conjunction with a local drug gang. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo)

An additional 14 police officers have been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Murillo Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighboring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in disappearing the students.

The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Murillo Karam said that officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack, but that the collusion might have gone beyond just one town.

""There's a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it's clear to me that they were working together,"" he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala to pass the hat for their school. Teachers college students are known throughout Mexico for using radical tactics to raise money and spread their leftist philosophy.

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, leading investigators to comb the clandestine burial sites outside of Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

""Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,"" Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification is an arduous process that takes time. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves can leave very little DNA for testing.

""If a bone is burned at more than 300 degrees, it's almost impossible to identify because the collagen is burned. Because of that, criminal organizations started to adopt that technique,"" said Jorge Arturo Talavera, head of the bio-archaeology team at the Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History.

He said the way the remains are exhumed also can affect identification. If they're pulled out in a hurried manner, other identifying articles like jewelry or teeth get discarded.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched to the center of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday, taking a much more solemn tone after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organizers passed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1 million peso ($75,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles (212 kilometers) south of Mexico City, and set fire to some of the buildings.

Students from the school and local teachers blockaded the capital complex, pelting it with sticks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. The finance secretary of Guerrero state said six buildings were affected.

Also Tuesday, an alleged leader of the Guerreros Unidos killed himself during a confrontation with Mexican security forces Tuesday. Federal forces were carrying out an operation to capture Benjamin Mondragon, or ""Benjamon,"" when a gunbattle broke out, National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said.

Mondragon killed himself as he was about to be arrested, Rubido said, though he had no details on how.

The official said it was unclear whether Mondragon was involved in the students' disappearances.

President Enrique Pena Nieto said the disappearances ""are without doubt a topic that will lead the Mexican government at all levels to take actions that will prevent events like those in Iguala from ever occurring again."" He said the government ""will strengthen institutions, especially those involved in law enforcement, so that they act with greater reliability and efficiency.""

1797,"It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear.

However, a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the 'Bunbury Spiderman' belongs in nightmares, rather than real life.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist, says: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin'

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from 'a really burning sensation like a searing feeling' in his stomach.

He claimed he sought medical attention, at which point a dermatologist removed a 'tropical spider' from his stomach with tweezers.

The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the 'Bunbury Spiderman' story which went viral on Thursday, and was shared thousands of time around the world.

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia, said: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin.'

Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite, as some of these can resemble a spider.

He said if the creature had been collected, there would be less confusion as what it actually was, and would prevent the spread of a possible virus.

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin: 'Spiders need air to breathe. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive'

Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal.

'Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive,' he told The Age.

Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear.

It's not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science. Last month, Charles Griswold, a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, said the popular myth that 'humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year' was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence."
1799,"Oliver Ilic mutilated himself after his girlfriend threw him over because of his abilities as a lover.

A Macedonian man hacked off his own manhood after being dumped for having bad bedroom skills.

Jilted lover Oliver Ilic reportedly tossed his member in the trash after slicing it off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

The 22-year-old lay bleeding on the floor of his Kocani home for several minutes before calling emergency services.

Cops arrived and found his severed organ in the waste paper bin. A bloodstained Ilic reportedly told officers that his small penis was to blame for his ruined relationship.

And so, feeling it was useless, he decided to cut it off.

He was rushed to a local medical center, but doctors struggled to re-attach his phallus.

Ilic was transferred to a hospital in the capital city Skopje, where it was sewed back on during a delicate five-hour operation.

Medics said it would be ""some time"" before they know if the surgery was a success and if the penis will ever function properly again.

It's the second time a Macedonian man has carried out such a masochistic act in recent years, The Austrian Times reports.

A 40-year-old reportedly cut off his member, but it could be not attached after he flushed it down his toilet."
1800,"British authorities previously declined to name the suspect due to 'operational reasons'

The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been named today as Mohammed Emwazi.

The Washington Post and the BBC both named Emwazi as the Londoner seen in a series of horrific beheading videos.

They report that he was known to the security services but they had chosen not to disclose his name for 'operational reasons'.

The Washington Post said Emwazi, a former Westminster University student from west London, was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined IS.

Scotland Yard today refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

Jihadi John has appeared in a number of shocking videos where he is thought to have beheaded a number of western hostages.

Among those were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.

Emwazi, who was given the nickname Jihadi John after freed hostages revealed he and other British ISIS members were 'jokingly' likened to the Beatles, first appeared in a video last August, when he appeared to kill the American journalist James Foley.

1802,"New York City continues to seek ways to cut down on the large number of low-level arrests stemming from marijuana possession.

The NYPD plans to stop arrests for small amounts of marijuana, instead opting to issue court summonses, according to a report Nov. 9 in the New York Times. It wasn't immediately clear what threshold the city will use to determine low-level procession or when the new policy will be implemented.

Brooklyn has stopped prosecuting most low-level marijuana cases, the borough's district attorney said July 8. The policy change in New York's most populous borough makes exceptions for those with a criminal history or who smoke marijuana in public places or near children.

Blacks and Hispanics comprised 86% of all marijuana arrests in New York by August, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project. The Brooklyn district attorney's office has dismissed 849 marijuana cases since July, or about 34% of the 2,526 total cases in Brooklyn.

A 2013 New York Civil Liberties Union report called New York City ""the nation's marijuana arrest capital."" It said that that in 2010, King's County (Brooklyn) had 20,413 marijuana-related arrests and summonses, more than any other county in the state. The majority of arrests were of black people.

""Given that these cases are ultimately — and predictably — dismissed, the burdens that they pose on the system and the individual are difficult to justify. We are pouring money into an endeavor that produces no public safety benefit.""
Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson
Thompson said the policy change was meant to avoid giving criminal records to nonviolent individuals, particularly young people of color.

""Our police officers must enforce the laws of the State of New York uniformly throughout all five boroughs of the City. Accordingly, the Kings County policy change will not result in any changes in the policies and procedures of the NYPD.""
Bill Bratton, New York City police commissioner
Bratton said in a statement on July 8 that police officers will continue to enforce the law, despite the district attorney's decision to stop prosecuting low-level crimes. A spokesman for the Staten Island district attorney said his borough would also ""enforce the law.""

Controversial policy ended:
NYC 'Stop and Frisk' Debate

1803,"GAZA, Feb. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian minister lashed out at Israel on Sunday after it opened its dams near the border with the Gaza Strip, flooding the central area of the besieged enclave with huge amounts of water.

Mufid al-Hasaynah, minister of Housing and Public Works in the Palestinian unity government, told Xinhua that Israel deliberately increases the suffering of the Gazans.

""Dozens of houses were filled with water of the Israeli dams, which were largely opened this morning towards the Gaza Strip. These actions double the people's suffering who live under a tight Israeli siege,"" said the minister.

Early on Sunday, rescue teams and firefighters rushed to the central area of the Gaza Strip to rescue dozens of Palestinians who were stuck in their houses after Israel opened the dams.

Witnesses said that bulldozers were bringing sands to reduce the amounts of water that covered the houses in the area and that several main roads and streets were closed due to the floods.

The Gaza-based Ministry of Interior said in an emailed press statement that the civil defense teams rescued 18 families after their homes were fully covered with water that came from the Israeli side.

Mohamed Abu Shamallah, head of the Gaza civil defense, said that the level of water in the area in central Gaza Strip grew up to three meters and a half."
1804,"Seven girls from a Bosnian school, all aged between 13 and 14, have fallen pregnant during a five-day school trip to the country's capital, Sarajevo.

The school is based in the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, and took 28 teenage girls on an educational visit to the city with intentions to visit museums and places of historical significance.

But it seems the unsupervised girls got up to a lot more than that while they were staying away from home. The case has triggered serious discussion about the state of Bosnia's sex education, with the number of 13-15-year-old girls having underage sex having seen a dramatic spike in recent times.

A Sarajevo-based gynaecologist, Senad Mehmedbasic, commented on how concerning the increase in underage pregnancies is. ""That is the trend of today,"" he said. ""But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school.""

And continuing his point that education is the key to reducing the number of girls having underage sex, he said:

""It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""
The parents of the girls are now understandably furious that such lack of care was taken to keep an eye on their children's activities. But the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, Nenad Babici, believes the blame shouldn't lie with the teachers on the trip, but the ""parental neglect"" that caused the lack of reproductive understanding in the young girls.

We're sure there is some truth in what he says - that it is the duty of parents as well as schools to inform their children of the dangers of unprotected sex both at such a young age, and throughout their adult lives. But for 7 out of 28 pupils - that's a staggering 25% of girls who attended the trip - to have become pregnant is surely primarily down to the neglect of teachers, who should have made it their duty to keep an eye on the girls for the duration?"

1806,"Michael Phelps may be off to rehab trying to find himself, but before his latest brush with the law, he allegedly could often be found with Taylor Lianne Chandler.


Taylor Lianne Chandler is Michael Phelps' alleged cougar girlfriend. This was sent to THG directly from a source claiming it's from her. Decide for yourself in this gallery!
Late last week, a tipster contacted The Hollywood Gossip to reveal that Phelps had been with Taylor Lianne Chandler the night of his DUI arrest.

Are they an item? We can't say for certain, but some online sleuthing and a second anonymous email to THG reveal the above photos to be Chandler.

Phelps was reportedly boozing and gambling in a casino for several hours before getting behind the wheel at around double the legal BAC last week.

Our tipster in the Canton area of Batlimore, where Michael lives, claims he is involved with Chandler, a Washington, D.C. resident, on the down-low.

""We saw a blonde model type leaving Michael Phelps' place,"" our source says, recalling a recent incident in which the two were spotted together.

""She went to the bar across the street, Plug Ugly's, where she was on her phone,"" says our insider, noting that things weren't going too swimmingly.

Calling and texting and crying at times, she was writing to ""Michael"" and she said she was in town from Washington for business in crisis management.

She did not seem like she was there on business, however, and was later seen coming out of Michael Phelps' place crying as he put her into a car.

Locals ""have seen her many times going into his place in the past few months,"" the source added, including ""the night he was arrested for DUI.""

The source describes Taylor as a ""tall, swimsuit model type."" Cougar would be another word some have used to describe her since this story broke.

It's not clear if Phelps is (or was) still dating Win McMurry, a sportscaster from the Golf Channel, but the dude is clearly losing at life these days.

Phelps is going to rehab, he confirms on Twitter, following his latest arrest, in hopes of focusing on himself and being a better person, et cetera.


Have any tips that could confirm whether something is really going on with these two, or his status with McMurry? Drop us a line and let us know!"
1807,"Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance.

Three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad that's been under ISIS control since June 2014. The reports, however, have perpetuated mostly in pro-government and Kurdish media.

""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications told Mashable.

Feig added that WHO is in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases, a task that could be a challenge, given the restrictions that would come with operating in ISIS-controlled territory.

It's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants' symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

However, Ebola symptoms — nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising — are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa.

Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" and Africa.

While ISIS has recruited foreign fighters, very few of them — if any at all — are believed to have traveled from West Africa.

The majority of the Islamic State's African fighters came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report. Others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

If the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola — a scenario that, at this point, seems highly unlikely — it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine.

Over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, a Middle East-based geopolitical risk and research consultancy.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" Decker, who specializes in Iraq, told Mashable.

""In this context,"" he said, ""the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

To be exact, what the executive supposedly said was that he uses it everywhere, even in the shower. We presume that it is a subtle confirmation that the Apple Watch will be more rugged that first thought. This would perhaps allay the worries of some over the device's ""water resistant"" only properties. Especially in a time where other smartwatches (read: Android Wear) are boasting IP67 ratings.

The one place that Tim Cook doesn't take his Apple Watch to is apparently his bed. And it's not for the lack of would be activity or sleep tracking apps. The CEO admits that he does charge it every night. That's not surprising considering Apple itself said that the Apple Watch would have enough battery to last you a day. That, however, might exclude the wearable from night activities, like sleep tracking. It might also not satisfy those who are wary of smartwatches exactly because they have to charge it every night.

Will the Apple Watch face tougher times, especially with the longer lasting, cross-platform, and now colorful Pebble Time, or even the rugged but classy LG Watch Urbane? Hardly, if we take sales of any Apple device as an indication. However, there is no denying the fact that Apple is treading new ground and it has to take care to tread carefully if the Apple Watch is to go beyond a one hit wonder.

1813,"A YouTube video claimed to show the incident in Moscow but was fake

Monday 04 August 2014

A video of Vladimir Putin apparently being pooped on by a passing bird during a speech has proved to be a fake.

Footage uploaded to YouTube claimed to show the embarrassing incident as the Russian President spoke at the unveiling of a First World War memorial in Moscow on Friday.

Even by Putin’s ice man standards, he did seem remarkably unfazed by the present on his shoulder – probably because it was never there.

In all other footage of the event the bird poo is nowhere to be seen and it does not appear on any pictures taken by multiple international agencies.

If the incident had been real, it would not have been Putin’s first public encounter with an animal’s rear end – in September he drew a cat’s backside for confused Russian pupils on a school visit.

Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister used a picture of his superior with a leopard to show the “different values” between his country and the US and Putin has also been seen “shaking hands” with a walrus and feeding dolphins.

The Russian President is known for using photo opportunities with animals to cultivate his “macho” image.

If his PR is to be believed, he likes nothing more than a holiday horse-riding topless through the wilds of southern Russia, catching huge pike or harpooning whales.

Unluckily for many for the animals involved, Putin’s publicity stunts can end badly, as with the Siberian tiger that died after being over-sedated so the President could attach a GPS transmitter.

1814,"In 2015, there’s the quality-fake news and the crappy-fake news.

Examples? Of course.

The quality: Fake news source The Onion quoted fake people on a very real, if unbelievable, subject on March 3, 2015: As the Utah Senate weighed legal medical marijuana last week, a DEA agent testified that he came across “rabbits that had cultivated a taste for the marijuana” while eradicating illegal pot farms in the wild back-country. It’s hard to believe, a drug enforcement agent’s encounter with stoned rabbits, but that part’s real. The fake part: The Onion quoted fake people’s reactions to the all-too-real news. “Rabbits are going to be getting high anyway,” one hilariously fake person said. “Better that it be safe, legal, and regulated.”

The crappy: Fake news site The Daily Currant wrote a story under the headline “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37 in Colorado On First Day of Legalization” on Jan. 2, 2014. It began ridiculously: “Colorado is reconsidering its decision to legalize recreational pot following the deaths of dozens due to marijuana overdoses.” How anyone could believe such a story, from such an outlet, is still dumbfounding.

And now some more fake news is on the loose — and it falls on the crappy, lowest-common-denominator side. The Racket Report already has hundreds of thousands of shares on its recent piece, “KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.”

Nevermind the story and its preposterous hypothetical for just one moment — what about the scrolling “News Ticker” above the headline pitching other “news” including “Exclusive Photos Of Miley Cyrus And Justin Bieber’s Wedding!” and “69 People Die After Drinking Bad Coors Lite At A Funeral.” Neither of those headlines threw off the 200,000-plus people sharing this story to their own social media?

The Racket Report’s piece said KFC “decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants. Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee. The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License. Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this ‘option’ to their menu.”

Sounds believable, right?

Wrong. As I wrote a year ago as the “Marijuana Overdoses Kill 37″ story was going viral:

We’re all too discerning to believe everything we read online. But you read this and didn’t check (the site’s) About page or proven, local-to-Colorado news sources before Facebooking it. Next time you see a major piece of news being reported by an unrecognized entity, you might think to question its content before spreading it as fact.

The Racket Report’s About page says “some stories on this website are fictitious.” Gee, really?

The beauty of the weed-at-KFC ridiculousness comes in the news that there is a KFC selling marijuana in California — though it’s a Kind For Cures medical dispensary and not a Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant, as Inquisitr reported.

The shop’s website even notes, “This ain’t no chicken joint!”"
1815,"(Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.

North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.

""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.

If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.

""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

NOT KIM'S FIRST ABSENCE

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort"".

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were ""rubbish"".

""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.

Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition.

Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.

""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said.

1817,"The FBI is reportedly investigating a new audiotape that allegedly captures the shooting of Michael Brown, according to CNN.

In the tape, you can hear what sounds like at least 10 shots fired, with a significant pause separating the shooting into two segments. CNN's Don Lemon said the news network hasn't confirmed the tape's authenticity. Michael Brown was shot at least six times according to an autopsy.

Lopa Blumenthal, a Missouri-based attorney for the unidentified man who unknowingly captured the shooting while video-chatting with a friend, claimed on CNN that the tape shows that Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson had a ""point of contemplation"" before firing the final volley of shots.

The man who recorded the audio ""was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,"" Blumenthal said. ""He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.""

""I was very concerned about that pause,"" she said, ""because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""

It wasn't clear whether Blumenthal had any direct connection to the Brown case.

Retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog, speaking on CNN after hearing the tape, said, ""There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern.""

The tape appears to have drawn the interest of Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family. He retweeted a tweet Wednesday night from a CNN viewer that said, ""Audio recording of shooting just released. Has been played on CNN by Don Lemon at least 5 xs. Very interesting. Proves alot [sic].""

1819,"A holidaymaker was left horrified after discovering a tropical spider had burrowed underneath his skin during a trip to Bali.

Dylan Thomas was abroad with friends when he discovered the strange red trail stretching two inches across his stomach.

The 21-year-old Australian was told by doctors at the Bali International Medical Centre that he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an insect bite and was sent away with some antihistamine cream.

But three days later, when the red mark began to blister, and almost double in length, Mr Thomas knew there was something wrong.

After going back to the medical centre to see a dermatologist, health professionals were shocked to discover that a tropical spider was burrowing just below the surface of his skin.

Doctors managed to extract the spider from Mr Thomas' abdomen and revealed that the insect had buried itself into the scar from his recent appendix removal."
1820,"Taylor Lianne Chandler, a woman who claims to be Michael Phelps' girlfriend, has revealed that she was born intersex and was given the name David Roy Fitch at birth.

As per the Intersex Society of North America, intersex is:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types. 

Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy Facebook post outlining her journey but admits that she has never told some people, including Phelps, about her past. 

She writes: 

By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.

[...]

The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past. If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.

Eighteen-time Olympic gold medalist Phelps spent most of October in a rehab centre after being arrested for driving under the influence in September. 

Chandler says she met Phelps on the dating app Tinder and described their relationship as being ""like a teenage love affair.""

However, she admitted concern in her post that Phelps would end their relationship: 

I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman. When he went to rehab I had to go through all this scrutiny and tabloid mess by myself. His team at Octagon abandoned me, whether he knows that or not I do not know.

Chandler wrote her Facebook post on November 13th, but it has only now been widely picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror.

On Wednesday, she wrote, ""Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home,"" while also expressing frustration about how her story is being reported. 

Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards. That is what life feels like to me right now. In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say Michael Phelps is dating a MAN. I have cried now for an hour, thrown up anything in my system till I dry heaved. I just can't believe this is happening in 2014!"
1821,"By Isaac Abrak ABUJA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - A man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said more than 200 girls kidnapped by the group six months ago had been ""married off"" to its fighters, contradicting Nigerian government claims they would soon be freed. Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos. In the latest recording it is hard to see the man's face as he his filmed from a distance. But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls, who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April. ""We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,"" the man claiming to be Shekau says. ""The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam, which they confess is the best religion. Either their parents accept this and convert too or they can die."" The majority of the kidnapped girls were Christians. The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire, and denounced Ahmadu, who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad. ""Who says we are dialoguing or discussing with anybody? Are you talking to yourselves? We don't know anybody by the name of Danladi. If we meet him now we will cut off his head,"" the man in the video says. ""All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns ... War is what we want."" He says also that they are holding a ""white man."" The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram. Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu. The five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer. Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire. They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said. A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said. The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that it cannot control. There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group.

1822,"A small town sits on Federal Highway 95. Just a short two-hour drive away from Mexico City, Iguala is plagued by the tragic triangulation between gangsters, crooked cops, and beleaguered government officials. On Saturday, the burned bodies of 28 people, believed to be missing student protesters, were found in a mass grave just outside the city center.

The students went missing on September 25 after a protest over hiring practices at the Ayotzinapa Normal School turned violent. The students are known as radicals who have done battle with police in the past. This time, police officers reportedly opened fire on the protesters, killing three. However, officials and students tell very different stories of how the protests ended.

Students have said they were attempting to leave the scene of the protest by bus, only to be chased by officers who opened fire, whereas officials have said the students ""commandeered the buses by force,"" resulting in the violence. Those investigating the mass grave found video showing the police officers arresting and taking away an undisclosed number of students.

Iguala is the door to the cartel-controlled Tierra Caliente territory, where gangs recently burned four trucks transporting Coca-Cola to the ground and the opium trade is still alive and well. The area cartels—which rival one another in both drug sales and acts of brutality—have been implicated in the deaths of the 28 students, by several mobsters-turned-police tipsters who disclosed the location of the bodies.

Police officers in Iguala have been linked to the Guerreros Unidos gang, including the mayor and chief of security, both of whom are wanted for arrest. Members of Guerreros Unidos got their start as the hitman division of the Beltran Leyva Organization and are known for extremely violent and aggressive deaths, and public displays of beheading victims.

Mexico state prosecutor Inaky Blanco told AFP that he believes ""El Chucky,"" leader of Guerreros Unidos, ordered the students to be murdered after security chief Francisco Salgado Valladares directly asked for the assistance of El Chucky's men at the location of the buses. Thus far, authorities have charged 22 police officers with involvement in the crime, as well as seven others.

Blanco has not confirmed whether the bodies are those of the protesting students. He believes experts will need at least 15 days for the identification process, as many of the bodies have been dismembered and are charred beyond visual recognition."
1825,"A MYSTERIOUS explosion that rocked Nicaragua’s crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed “2014 RC,” which passed very close to Earth yesterday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres big, or the size of a house.

“We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,” said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss’s organisation uses to size up earthquakes.

“You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,” he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday. One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

“You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,” Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Managua would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about “this fascinating event” in the Central American nation, one of Latin America’s poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be approximately one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach.

The South American nun belongs to an order in Macerata, in the eastern Italian region of Le Marche. She arrived there last June, and people suspect now that she was already pregnant by the time she was admitted.

She was rushed to the emergency department of 'Bartolomeo Eustachio' di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters after she complained of a severe stomach ache, and doctors immediately deduced that the nun was about to give birth.

She soon delivered a healthy baby boy, but the child currently remains in the hospital to undergo more checks. The Macerata nuns have expressed their desire to keep the baby and raise him. For her part, the nun said she had no idea that she was pregnant prior to her hospital admission.

This is not the first time a nun has mysteriously given birth after suffering from stomach pains. The South American nun's case is very similar to what happened to a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun, also in Italy last year. She complained of unbearable stomach pain, was rushed to the hospital, and gave birth afterwards. She named her baby boy after Pope Francis.

The Salvadorean nun told her social worker that she does not feel any guilt and only expressed eagerness to raise the child. ""I am so happy. He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun,"" she admitted, according to the Daily Mail.

Back in 2011 a Congolese nun in an Italian order also gave birth to a baby girl. However, the Congolese nun's experience was different since she was raped by a priest.

(RNS) When Pope Francis recently sought to comfort a distraught boy whose dog had died, the pontiff took the sort of pastoral approach he is famous for — telling the youngster not to worry, that he would one day see his pet in heaven.

“Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” Francis said reassuringly.

 This image is available for Web and print publication. For questions, contact Sally Morrow.

It was a sparkling moment on a rainy November day, and the setting in St. Peter’s Square only burnished Francis’ reputation as a kindly “people’s pope.” The story naturally lit up social media, became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups, and on Friday even made it to the front page of The New York Times.

There’s only one problem: apparently none of it ever happened.

Yes, a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope, but it was said decades ago by Paul VI, who died in 1978. There is no evidence that Francis repeated the words during his public audience on Nov. 26, as has been widely reported, nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog.

So how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact?

Part of the answer may be the topic of the pope’s talk to the crowd that day, which centered on the End Times and the transformation of all creation into a “new heaven” and a “new earth.” Citing St. Paul in the New Testament, Francis said that is not “the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us, but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being.”

The trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an Italian news report that extended Francis’ discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven.

“One day we will see our pets in the eternity of Christ,” the report quoted Paul VI as telling a disconsolate boy years ago.

The story was titled, somewhat misleadingly: “Paradise for animals? The Pope doesn’t rule it out.” It wasn’t clear which pope the writer meant, however.

The next day, Nov. 27, a story in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera by veteran Vaticanista Gian Guido Vecchi pushed the headline further: “The Pope and pets: “Paradise is open to all creatures.”

Vecchi faithfully recounted the pope’s talk about a new creation, and also cited Paul VI’s remark.

But the headline put those words in Francis’ mouth, and that became the story.

The Italian version of the Huffington Post picked it up next and ran an article quoting Francis as saying “We will go to heaven with the animals” and contending that the pope was quoting St. Paul – not Pope Paul – as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog. (That story, by the way, is nowhere in the Bible.)

The urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into English and picked up by the British press, which cited St. Paul as saying that “One day we will see our animals again in (the) eternity of Christ,” while it has Francis adding the phrase: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.”

Fueling the meme was the fact that Francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cow’s milk – and Francis said his own mother gave him donkey’s milk as a baby.

Social media and other media outlets then picked up the story, further conflating the statements and the chronology. It became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.

The New York Times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets, paradise, and Pope Francis.
When The New York Times went with the story, along with input from ethicists and theologians, it became gospel truth.

Television programs discussed the pope’s theological breakthrough, news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals, and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife. At America magazine, the Rev. James Martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of Francis’ statements and what level of authority they may have. It was all very interesting and illuminating, but based on a misunderstanding.

A number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck:

The story had so much going for it: Francis took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters.
Pope Francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment, and almost since the day he was elected in 2013 he has stressed the Christian duty to care for creation.
Francis also blessed a blind man’s guide dog shortly after he was elected, an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals.
Moreover, the media and the public are so primed for Francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out; it fit with the pattern.
In most accounts, Francis’ comments were also set against statements by his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who insisted that animals did not have souls. That apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative Benedict against the ostensibly liberal Francis.

That may be true in some areas, but probably not when it comes to animals.

Adding insult to injury, the Times article cited St. John Paul II as saying in 1990 that animals have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But that, too, was a misquote, as media critic Dawn Eden explained at the website GetReligion.

On the other hand, there should have been warnings signs: Francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people, and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry.

In addition, the pope’s huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of myth-making: news reports last year said that Francis was sneaking out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless around Rome.

The pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last March, saying the idea “has never crossed my mind” and that “depicting the pope to be a sort of superman, a type of star, seems offensive to me.”

Maybe he’ll have to give another interview to deflate this latest story, and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise.

1834,"What happens in Vegas…is apparently fair game for an earnings conference call.
MGM Resorts International unintentionally outed Vice Media CEO Shane Smith’s ridiculously expensive $300,000 dinner at the Bellagio casino’s Prime Steakhouse in January. Asked yesterday about spending levels at the company’s casinos, MGM CEO James Murren bragged about the tab to Nomura analyst Harry Curtis: “$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That’s a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry.”
Murren didn’t identify the person who ran up the six-figure bill, but Bloomberg reporters quickly connected the dinner to Smith, who at the time of the meal was in the midst of a hot run at the blackjack tables, which was apparently witnessed by the late New York Times media columnist David Carr:
The Times’ Dealbook blog later reported that Smith’s gambling winnings exceeded $1 million, citing anonymous people who attended the dinner.
With accounts of the guestlist ranging from 12 to 30, it’s hard to imagine how the outspoken Smith and his guests ran up such a stupendous tab without buying some monumentally expensive booze. A 28 oz. bone-in rib eye, Prime’s most expensive dish, sells for $85, pan-roasted Dover sole will run you $66, and a lobster tail goes for $62—but the steakhouse’s wine list includes bottles that sell for more than $20,000.
A Vice spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The media company recently secured a $500 million funding round that values it at more than $2.5 billion.
Smith also has yet to comment on the dinner. Perhaps he thinks MGM has already said enough."
1835,"(Reuters) - The Pentagon is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed al Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, but if confirmed the militant's death would represent a ""very significant"" blow to the group, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

Rear Admiral John Kirby told a Pentagon briefing that the U.S. special operations strike conducted on Monday involved manned and unmanned aircraft. Kirby said Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were dropped on the camp in south-central Somalia, but he said it was too soon to say what the results of the strike had been.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled the group as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has taken over important state duties from her ailing brother, as he recovers from a mysterious illness, it has been reported.

According to a Seoul-based think tank, Kim Yo-jong has been entrusted with handling crucial government powers by Pyongyang's top political body in September, after doctors said the Supreme Leader was in need of extended medical treatment to restore his health.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity (NKIS) said, Japanese magazine The Diplomat reported.

Other decisions taken at the emergency meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, which was reportedly called by Kim Yo-jong herself, included upholding orders issued by the dictator before he fell ill and placing the army on wartime-like alert.

Kim Yo-jong, believed to be 26, was a shadowy figure before making her public debut as a government official in March, as she accompanied her elder brother at a polling satiation for parliamentary elections.

She was shown on North Korean state TV trailing her brother and party officials on the way to casting votes at Kim Il-sung University of Politics in Pyongyang.

Dressed in a black skirt suit, she was identified by commentators as ""comrade Kim Yo-jong"" and described as a senior official, a rank she has not previously been known to hold.

She had been earlier seen in tears at Kim Jong-il's funeral in 2011 and has appeared sporadically alongside her brother over the past few years.

Analysts said that her ascent in the party ranks signalled the increasing grip on power of Kim's family.

Meanwhile the reasons for Kim's sustained absence from the public scene continue to be the subject of speculation.

He was last seen on 3 September during a concert flanked by his wife. He was walking with a limp at the performance, sparking claims he has since undergone surgery for fractured ankles.

Other reports suggested the Supreme Leader has been suffering from gout.

However, reports from the hermit nation are impossible to confirm and often suffer from South Korean sensationalism.

1837,"It seems like robots are everywhere these days, and now they’re rolling around Microsofts Silicon Valley campus R2-D2-style to fight crime and keep everyone safe. At least that’s the idea behind a pilot program the company ran last week to test a fleet of five K5 security guard robots.

Designed and manufactured by robotics company Knightscope, K5s weigh 300 pounds and are 5 feet tall. They use cameras and sensors to keep track of their surroundings and look for suspcious activity. They can “see” license plate numbers and even analyze faces. While K5s aren’t equipped with weapons (and can’t run or get in someone’s face anyway), they do have onboard alarms and sirens to alert people if something bad is going on. And if they spot something that a person should handle, they can call a human security guard over. The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigating, weather sensors, and, of course, Wi-Fi connectivity.

Stacy Stephens, Knightscope’s co-founder and vice president of sales and marketing, told MIT Tech Review, “This takes away the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work, and leaves the strategic work to law enforcement or private security, depending on the application.”

K5s are mostly meant for spotting strange or unusual behavior, but if you’re in trouble you can also use them to call for help. They have battery life of about 24 hours and can automatically bring themselves back to their charging stations when they’re low on juice. And it’s true that there’s artificial intelligence coordinating an A5’s actions and making decisions about where it should go and what it should do next. But reaction to the robots seems kind of alarmist.

ExtremeTech writes that by testing the robots, Microsoft is “[s]howing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization.” That and other comments might be meant as tongue-in-cheek, but the A5s don’t seem any different from the robot guards South Korea piloted in prisons in 2012 or even Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot, which is designed to be used in dangerous situations like natural disaster relief or fire rescues.

If they were armed, A5s might seem scarier, but as eyes and ears that never get tired and can just endlessly putter around a big campus, A5s seem like a reasonable solution."
1839,"A man in Carlisle who slaps locals if they are caught sneezing is being hunted by police.

The man, who is described as middle-aged, first assaulted a woman on Monday, smacking her around the back of the head after she sneezed, in what police have described as ‘very strange behaviour’.

And on Tuesday, detectives believe that the same man launched an unprovoked attack on a frail 82-year-old woman in Scotch Street, at roughly 11.30 am.

Cumbria Police have described the prime suspect as wearing a tweed jacket and being in his mid-to-late 50s.

They are yet to trace the first victim, who was female, but said they believe that the two crimes are linked.

Sgt Gill Cherry said: ‘We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

‘It is very unusual behaviour and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.’

Gemma Prosser, 19, who witnessed the attack, said: ‘we heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

‘When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it’s not your fault’.

But Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, from nearby Kendal, said that she would not be frightened to retaliate.

‘I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold’, she said.

‘If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back’.

1840,"The man who scaled the White House fence and was able to run through the front doors made it farther into the building than was previously reported, CBS News has learned.

The man, 42-year-old Omar J. Gonzalez, ran unobstructed for 70 yards across the front lawn of the White House before entering through the North Portico. On the way, he brushed by a Secret Service officer with a drawn gun, CBS News' Bill Plante reports.

Gonzalez then proceeded to run through the entrance hall to the cross hall of the White House, past the staircase that leads up to the first family's residence. He was confronted by a female Secret Service agent, who he overpowered, and was only brought down by a door leading to the Green Room, a parlor adjacent to the East Room of the White House that is used for formal events including bill signings, press conferences, receptions and ceremonies.

Previously, it was reported that Gonzalez only made it through the north doors of the White House - which were apparently unlocked - before being apprehended by the Secret Service.

""He had just gotten inside the door [of the North Portico] . . . And was then wrestled to the ground by one of the Secret Service personnel . . . in the foyer,"" former Secret Service Director W. Ralph Basham, told CBS news, explaining his understanding of the apprehension. Basham spoke with current director Julia Pierson as recently as this weekend.

Basham said that he believed ""as soon as the individual got in the door . . . he was apprehended by one person.""

Secret Service erects second barrier after White House fence-jumper
Secret Service shortcomings have Congress demanding answers
The major security breach occurred Sept. 19, just minutes after President Obama, his daughters and one of their friends boarded the presidential helicopter for a weekend getaway to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The first lady had traveled there separately. It prompted the Secret Service to erect a second fence about 12 feet further away from the White House than the permanent fence, creating second barrier that would-be fence jumpers would have to climb.

Officials originally argued the reason agents didn't shoot the suspect, Omar Gonzalez, as he sprinted across the lawn or release guard dogs to detain him was because he appeared unarmed. In fact, he was found carrying a two-and-a-half inch folding knife with a serrated blade and his car reportedly contained 800 rounds of ammunition.

The revelations will only heighten concerns about an agency that has had several high-profile security failures in recent years. On Sunday, the Washington Post reported that it took agents four days to realize a man had fired bullets that struck the White House in 2011.

Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are set to grill Secret Service Director Julia Pierson Tuesday during a hearing that was first called after Gonzalez jumped the fence and entered the building.

Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told CBS News. ""There are other incidents that we might talk about but we're also going to reach back during her tenure to review what has happened and not happened.""

In an interview Sunday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, told CBS News that it will be very difficult for the American people to trust the agency after the last incident.

While negotiations were never fully under way, sources tell Variety that Bale had talks with director Danny Boyle about taking on the role, but a deal never came to fruition.

This is an extremely brave move (if true) as it puts Star Wars up against films like Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long awaited Jurassic World but who would win at the summer box office if it were to happen? In my opinion Star Wars has got the strongest chance at the box office if moved to a summer release but why would he do it? All the big films come out in the summer and I mean there's no Hobbit to compete with in December so why move it down to Summer?

Box office championship.
Box office championship.
J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching. For example just one photo can give away a lot for instance: (If you don't want spoilers look away!)

Sorry J J!
Sorry J J!
For instance these 5 figures reveal the character's Kylo Ren, Rey, Fin, BB-8 and shows us what Kylo Ren (ol' crossguard) will look like with his outer cloak removed. I do see that if more of these pictures are leaked we could be seeing what Han, Leia, Luke, C3PO etc. will be like in the film before seeing a company made trailer, which would ruin the surprise. Disney, being the owners of the new Star Wars franchise, have taken J J's thoughts into consideration and deep thought which could get the film released a lot earlier than we thought we were going to see it! There are some bad things about this though... If we do get what we all wish for and we get to see Star Wars 7 about 6 months before we thought we were going to, won't Disney be in a panic? If they thought that their blockbuster was coming in December would they have ordered toy designs, trailers etc. for later on in the year? Perhaps this is just paranoia but Disney and J J will have a lot of work to get done if they want their merchandise etc. to come alongside Star Wars in summer.

1844,"SANA, Yemen — An American journalist held for more than a year by Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen was killed during a rescue attempt by United States commandos late Friday, a senior United States official said.

Early reports of the overnight raid were sketchy. The official said that the journalist, Luke Somers, 33, was apparently shot by his captors as the raid unfolded and was badly wounded when the commandos reached him. By the time Mr. Somers was flown to a United States naval ship in the region, he had died from his injuries, the official said Saturday.

There was no immediate comment from the Obama administration about the raid, which took place in the southern Yemeni province of Shabwa. When asked about the operation at a security conference in Bahrain, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the head of United States Central Command, declined to comment.

Mr. Somers’ sister, Lucy Somers, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she had been notified by the FBI of her brother’s death. “We ask that all of Luke’s family members be allowed to mourn in peace,” she said.

Mr. Somers, a freelance journalist, was abducted in the Yemeni capital, Sana, in September 2013. Last month, United States commandos and Yemeni counterterrorism troops made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue him in a remote Yemeni province.

On Wednesday, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni extremist group that was holding Mr. Somers, threatened to kill him by the end of the week if its demands were not met. In the video, a leader of the group spoke of the November raid and warned the United States not to carry out any similar operations.

The dog, a male shar-pei named Kai, was found sitting with a leash attached to a banister at the Ayr railway station on Jan. 2, according to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature,"" Scottish SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said in the group's release.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,"" Taylor said.

Officials were able to determine the dog's name because the animal had been microchipped by a previous owner. When they contacted that individual, he reported that he had sold the dog in 2013 but did not have any information on the new owner.

1857,"Those caught with the same moniker as the dictator would apparently have to be ""trained"" to change it

North Korean citizens hoping to name themselves after Kim Jong-Un in the near future are out of luck, because the leader has banned the use of his moniker, and ordered those who already have it to be “trained” to change it.

According to the Daily Mail, South Korean television obtained a leaked internal document from the state that included an “administrative order” to army, police and government officials to establish the new legislation.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names,” it reportedly reads.

Those caught with the name Kim Jong-Un, it continued, would have their identity cards, school diplomas and official documents briskly adjusted.

Birth certificates baring the dictator’s name would also be rejected.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project,” the Mail further quotes the document as reading.

A spokesperson from the North Korean Embassy in London declined to comment on the authenticity of the report.

However, a South Korean official claimed that the two previous presidents of the secret state, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, similarly banned the sharing of their names.

“There is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,” he added.

The document was first obtained by Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for the KBS, who left the state in 2008.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un,” she said.

Mohammed Islam, a 17-year-old high school kid in New York, was profiled as a Wall Street whiz kid who was raking in millions. The New York Magazine piece implies that his wealth ($72 million or not) largely came from trading.

Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the ""high eight figures."" More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan—though his parents won't let him live in it until he turns 18—and acquire a BMW, which he can't drive because he doesn't yet have a license.
But the investment club that Islam belongs to sent a statement to Business Insider:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.
The journalist who wrote the piece defends it, saying that she saw a bank statement that confirms he's worth eight figures:


So what's the real story? We can only speculate at this point, but if history is any guide for Wall Street prodigy stories, most of his wealth could come from an inheritance. Just last month Yahoo Finance had to issue a correction about the story of a 27-year-old ""self-made"" millionaire. It turned out that probably 80 percent of that man's wealth came from an inheritance.

You can watch video of CNBC discussing the story of Mohammed Islam, the high school millionaire, below:


All this doesn't mean that Islam isn't still making decent coin from his trading, nor that he's not incredibly wealthy. He's just not worth $72 million and almost certainly didn't make the majority of his money trading stocks.

We'll have to wait until the dust settles for the real story on this one, but that could take a while. Islam cancelled an appearance on CNBC after getting spooked by producers in his pre-interview."
1859,"Axl Rose, the singer of Guns N’ Roses, has not died in West Hollywood at the age of 52.

A hoax news website designed to look like MSNBC was promulgating the false rumors this week. The site says MSNBC.website, which isn’t real.

Users on social media were questioning whether the “Chinese Democracy” singer was still alive.

The bogus story reads: “Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.”

It also includes fake quotes from police officers. The article has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook.

MSNBC.website was also responsible for a hoax that said Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin was found dead at age 34 a few weeks ago. That obviously wasn’t true, either.

Earlier his year, Rose said that Guns N’ Roses has two new albums in the works. The last album the band released was “Chinese Democracy” in November 2008, which was censored in China due to its title track and reference to Falun Gong, a traditional Chinese spiritual practice that has been persecuted in China for the past 15 years.

“We recorded a lot of things before ‘Chinese’ was out,” Rose told Rolling Stone.

He added: “We’ve worked more on some of those things and we’ve written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of Chinese. That’s already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from Chinese. That’s been done for a while, too. But after Vegas [Guns N’ Roses is performing a residency at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino that runs through June 7], we’re going to start looking very seriously at what we’re doing in that regard.”"
1860,"An Australian man rather understandably says his trip to Bali was ""ruined"" when he had a horrifying run-in with a disturbingly determined spider.

Twenty-one-year-old Dylan Thomas's horror story trip began while he was sleeping one night at his hotel: that's when a tropical spider climbed into his bed, burrowed through his appendix scar, crawled under his skin and tunneled into his sternum.

An initial visit to a doctor on Sunday saw him diagnosed as having been bitten by an insect and sent away with antihistamines.

Mr Thomas spent another day with the insect tunneling inside of him before going to a hospital.

""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,"" he told his Facebook friends.

The spider was eventually removed with tweezers. It was dead when pulled out.

Thomas says his friends now call him Spiderman, which is a pretty cool nickname even if you do never have another full night's sleep undisturbed by vivid nightmares again.

Meanwhile, the Washington Free Beacon reports that information about stolen jetliners was circulated within the U.S. government over the past two weeks — including an ominous warning that one or more jets could be used in an attack marking the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes in New York and Washington. 

""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,"" one unnamed official told the Free Beacon. ""We found out on Sept. 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.""

Sept. 11 also will mark the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Military groups in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have all been placed on heightened alert because of the stolen jets, the Free Beacon reports.

U.S. counterterrorism officials told the Free Beacon that intelligence agencies haven't confirmed the missing aircraft and are trying to locate all of the aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies.

Security in Libya has been deteriorating as Islamists and anti-Islamist militias battle. A shocking video surfaced Sunday showing armed fighters partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli, including one fighter jumping into a pool from a second-story balcony. 

Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, told the Free Beacon that commercial jets in the hands of terrorists could be ""devastating.""

""Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,"" he said. ""Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.""

Janes reported, however, that it was ""very unlikely"" that aircraft could have been taken from Tripoli International Airport without the knowledge of the Zintan militias that control it. 

With Misratah and Mitiga airports the only two functioning international airports in western Libya, Janes added, ""Misratan Islamist militias that control them will not want to jeopardize the political influence and revenue this affords them"" by facilitating a 9/11-style attack.

Even if the jihadists stole the aircraft,""they would still need to transport the jets to other paved runways large enough to facilitate takeoff ... heightening the risk such movements would be spotted by foreign intelligence agency surveillance.""

1866,"The man behind the Ottawa shootings is a Canadian convert to Islam whose passport had been seized by authorities, federal sources say.

While police have not confirmed the man's identity, sources have told Canada's Globe And Mail, Reuters and Associated Press that the main suspect was Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Just before 10am on Wednesday local time (1am AEDT Thursday), a gunman shot and killed Corporal Nathan Cirillo and then opened fire on the country's Parliament buildings.

Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, shot the suspect dead.

The suspected gunman, Zehaf-Bibeau, 23, was reportedly born Michael Joseph Hall but changed his name, sources said.

The Globe and Mail newspaper said he was recently designated a ""high-risk traveller"" by the Canadian government - meaning it was feared he would travel abroad to commit crimes - and that his passport had been seized.

Zehaf-Bibeau had a history of drug use and had multiple run-ins with Canadian police in the French-speaking province of Quebec.

Authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility that there are other shooters still on the loose.

On Monday, Martin Couture-Rouleau, a 25-year-old who converted to Islam last year, rammed his car into two soldiers in the Quebec town of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and was shot dead by police. One of the soldiers later died.

Rouleau was arrested at the airport in July on his way to Turkey and also had his passport confiscated.

He was among 90 people being tracked by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on suspicion of taking part in militant activities abroad or planning to do so.

Police would not confirm whether Zehaf-Bibeau was on this list.

No group, Islamic or otherwise, claimed responsibility for either the attack in Ottawa or the one near Montreal on Monday.

1867,"(Reuters) - First there was bendgate... now brace yourself for hairgate.

Fresh from the online uproar over whether the shiny new iPhone 6 bends when carried around in pockets, Apple has been hit by a new complaint - that the handset traps users' hair or beards when they make calls.

It is difficult to gauge whether there is any real issue, but Twitter users have made #hairgate a rising social media trend, leading major news outlets to pounce on the story.

""The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out,"" one user tweeted.

Bearded iPhone users have jumped on the bandwagon complaining that their facial hair gets yanked during calls, leading to spats over whether to treat #beardgate as a separate trend, or simply as a subset of #hairgate.

Apple was not immediately available to comment.

Jokers are having a field day, with the Twitter account of the Atlanta International Fashion Week speculating that it may be an elaborate plot against hipsters for whom facial hair has become de rigeur. Another user tweeted: ""Congrats, Apple, for finally getting hipsters to shave.""

For some it is a heaven-sent marketing opportunity; Gillette Co. [PGGIL.UL] was quick to tweet: ""Your phone may be smarter than ever, but leave the shaving to the experts.""

However, many iPhone 6 users were left to wonder what all the fuss was about.

""I have iPhone 6. Doesn't bend and doesn't snag hair. Who thinks up these things? Apple haters? Competitors?"" tweeted Dr. John Wooten, a Virginia-based technical consultant.

1871,"A video which supposedly proves that TBS speeds up its Seinfeld reruns by 7.5 percent in order to squeeze in two extra minutes of commercials has been online for a few months, but over the weekend it recirculated through Reddit, gathering a lot more attention. YouTube user ""ltclassics"" explains that the episode in the upper right hand corner is a recent TBS syndicated Seinfeld rerun. The episode on the lower right hand corner was supposedly a decade-old digitally recorded Seinfeld rerun.

 
So. Let's talk about efficiency. In the last two decades, American productivity has improved at striking levels, with very little benefit for the American worker. Some of this has to do with automation, and a lot of it has to do with the spread of personal computers. As the workplace is measured, re-measured, and examined to the point of indecency—look at the conditions Amazon warehouse employees have to work under—efficiency is slowly chipping away at our lives.

Even if this Seinfeld thing turns out to be a hoax—I am hedging my bets here, because I do not own a stopwatch or rent cable television—it's such a great symbol for America in the 21st century. You can picture some stuffed suit in middle-management watching the same Seinfeld episode sped up to various percentages—3.5, 10, 12.5—to see how the jokes land. They probably focus-tested specific jokes in midwestern malls in order to find the razor's edge of comedy, the exact line before Jerry Seinfeld turns into Alvin and the Chipmunks and the timing of all the jokes is ruined. Quantifiably it's the same show, but in reality it's stretched to just before the breaking point, analyzed and efficiency-tested in order to cram more salable real estate into a lot that refuses to change size. The life is being sucked out of it, one decimal point at a time."
1873,"'It's a nonsense', says official

North Korea has moved to deny reports its leader Kim Jong-un is planning to open a restaurant in Scotland.

The dictator presides over a chain of restaurants known as “Pyongyang”, with international branches already including Amsterdam, and a number of North Korea experts had speculated that Scotland would be a natural target for expansion.

Kim was reported to have taken a keen interest in Scottish affairs during the referendum debate in September, when officials claimed he felt a vote for independence “would be a very positive thing”.

It has also been noted that Scotch whisky is a favourite tipple among the North Korean elite, while tourists can be asked to make gifts of the drink to tour guides and hosts instead of cash.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told the Scotsman it “would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland”, while the UK-Korea Institute’s Jenny Town told the Mirror Kim would support “any country struggling for independence and legitimacy”.

But speaking to The Independent, an official at the North Korean embassy said of the reports: “It’s a nonsense.” He declined to comment further.

Mr Madden said the Pyongyang restaurants have been around for about 10 years, and that a significant proportion of their takings is funnelled back to government coffers.

He said they were one of the very few ways the majority of people can experience North Korean culture without making a trip to the secretive state. “But they tailor the menus to suit,” he added. “Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog!”"
1875,"When FXX took over the syndication rights of The Simpsons last year, one of the stipulations were older episodes with longer run-times were going to be edited to the modern standard of 22 minutes in order to fit in the now normal 8 minutes of advertising found within half-hour programming.

Not every network is so keen on trimming whole scenes to make run-times work for older shows, but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to tricks of their own. That’s reportedly what’s happening over at TBS.

Thanks to one crafty viewer, it seems to have been discovered that TBS has been running syndicated episodes of Seinfeld 7.5% faster than the show’s standard speed in order to squeeze in as much advertising as possible into the airspace. Unfortunately, while it’d be nice to say this news is shocking, it isn’t. These shows were meant to air at a time when most sitcoms ran 25 minutes, and thus it’s either this or a trim to The Simpsons in order to make them fit modern standards.

1876,"THIS is definitely NOT how to propose to your girlfriend.

A hopeless romantic determined to see his proposal go off with a bang ended up burning down his entire college sports hall with a box of fireworks - bought to mark the special occasion.

Dim Xiong Chien, 22, took three large boxes of fireworks on to campus, which he planned to set off as he got down one knee to pop the question to girlfriend Cong Yen, also 22.

But, when Ms Yen forgot to turn up, the young man ignited the fireworks anyway in the hope that she would see them and go and see what was happening.

However, the planned stunt went horribly wrong when the illuminations set fire to dry grass at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang, in north-eastern China's Liaoning province.

A friend, Shin Tan, 21, explained: ""He had prepared this big event in secret and had told her to meet him by the sports ground for a romantic walk.

""She had no idea he was planning to propose though, and clearly forgot all about the walk.""

As firemen rushed to the scene to put out the three-metre high flames engulfing the grass, Mr Chien went to look for his forgetful girlfriend.

He said he was ""completely unaware"" the fireworks had set fire to the grass.

He said: ""I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn't shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire.

""When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.""

However the disastrous proposal has not put the young romantic off.

Mr Chien added: ""As we approached the sports hall we saw all these flames and firemen and I decided to postpone the proposal to another date.""

Bewildered Ms Yen told local TV: ""I found out later that he wanted to ask me to marry him.

""Of course, I love him, but my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can't even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.""

It took firemen over an hour to extinguish the blaze.

A college spokesman added: ""The hall is covered by insurance and we have yet to make a decision about how to punish this student."""
1877,"A woman detained by Lebanese authorities was not the wife of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but the sister of a man convicted of bombings in southern Iraq,

Iraq’s interior ministry has said.

“The one detained by Lebanese authorities was Saja Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is detained by authorities and sentenced to death for his participation in … explosions,” a ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.

“The wives of the terrorist Al-Baghdadi are Asmaa Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Esraa Rajab Mahel al-Qaisi, and there is no wife in the name of Saja al-Dulaimi,” he said.

The spokesman said Saja Dulaimi had fled to Syria where she was detainees by authorities. She was part of a group of female detainees freed in exchange for the release of a group of nuns captured by Islamist rebels in Syria, he said.

But it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.
Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was ""almost impossible"" for the culprit to have been a spider.
""If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,"" he said.
""We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.""
Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case ""bizarre"".
""I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,"" he said.
""Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.
""Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.""
Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.
""We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,"" he said.
""None of those are true, they're just made up stories.
""They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.""
Something which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do ""live on humans"".
""We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,"" he said.
""They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.""
Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.
""It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,"" he said.
""If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.""

1881,"A statement attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group's main stronghold.

The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers — which usually take place around midday on Fridays — in airstrikes that targeted ""the same location for more than an hour.""

No ISIS militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed.

Has ISIS's latest horror show backfired in the Middle East?
It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown coloured three-storey building — but no images of the woman.

American officials said they were looking into the report, and the White House said it did not have immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government.

The ISIS statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by ISIS and was also distributed by ISIS-affiliated Twitter users.

Assisted refugees

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"" she said. ""It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.""

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.

A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. was ""deploying all the assets that we can"" to find Mueller.

""We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today Show. ""Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.""

Her identity had not been disclosed out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the ISIS militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing ISIS targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after ISIS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed ISIS training centres and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa on Friday. But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday."

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later.

An article has started circulating on Twitter today claiming that Banksy has been arrested.

The story on ""news"" website National Report says that Banksy was arrested in Watford after been tracked by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force"".

Stories crop up all the time claiming to reveal the true identity of the guerrilla graffiti artist, but this one is particularly ridiculous.

The National Report have also produced this video which claims to prove his arrest.

Video loading

Here's why it's definitely a hoax...

1. Banksy isn't from Liverpool

He's from Bristol according to his Wikipedia.

2. There's no London Police force

There's the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police, both used interchangeably in the article.

3. There's no London Police Chief called Lyndon Edwards

We call them The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. And he is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

4. Police don't release pictures of people being arrested

Nope. They definitely don't do that.

5. Met Police don't cover the Watford area.

That's Hertfordshire Police's job.

6. The website it comes from is full of spurious stories

Other headlines on the site include 'Kanye West applies for refugee status' and 'Miley Cyrus replaced by double in 2010'.

7. The same article was circulating last year as a press release

Before Banksy was Paul William Horner a 39 year old, rather than Paul Horner, a 35-year old.

8. The picture of him being arrested is from Notting Hill Carnival 2012

Put that picture URL into Google images and you get pictures from Carnival.

9. And as if you needed any more proof, Banksy's PR has confirmed it is a hoax

@JDBeauvallet it's a hoax— jo brooks (@brightonseagull) October 20, 2014

Nevertheless it looked real enough to fool many people - including former Tory MP Louise Mensch.

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 20, 2014

But it's definitely a hoax, Banksy's secret is still safe for now. Everyone back in your boxes until the next rumour appears.

Banksy’s real identity has been a closely kept secret ever since his work emerged in 1992.

Initially it was rumoured he was born Robin Banks, a former butcher.

However, more recently people believe he could be Robin Gunningham, who enjoyed a middle-class upbringing in Bristol.

During a rare interview he was described as “a cross of Jimmy Nail and British rapper Mike Skinner”.

Banksy has also claimed his parents think he is a painter and decorator.

Nigerian militant group Boko Haram claims to be holding a German hostage who was kidnapped from the state of Adamawa in northeastern Nigeria earlier this summer.
Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau made the announcement in a video obtained by news agency Agence France Presse. Shekau reportedly claims in the video that his group is ""holding your German hostage.""
The kidnapping occurred on July 16 in the town of Gombi in northeastern Nigeria, where the German national was reportedly a teacher at a government training center. The German Foreign Ministry has thus far refused to comment on the video.
The news comes after two Germans who were working in Nigeria for the construction company Julius Berger came under attack by gunmen on October 24. One was shot dead and the other taken hostage and later released.

The new video emerges as violence continues to cast doubt over ceasefire negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has been leading a violent uprising in northern Nigeria since 2009.
The Nigerian government says negotiations are taking place to secure the release of more than 200 schoolgirls whose abduction last spring from the town of Chibok sparked international outrage.
But Shekau reportedly claims in the video that earlier claims of a ceasefire between Boko Haram and the government are false, and that the schoolgirls had converted to Islam and been married off.
""We did not negotiate with anyone... It's a lie. It's a lie. We will not negotiate. What is our business with negotiation? Allah said we should not,"" AFP reported Shekau as saying.
""We have married [the girls] off. They are in their marital homes,"" Shekau reportedly says in the video while laughing.
Nigeria for its part maintains that it is conducting ceasefire negotiations and discussions to release the kidnapped girls in neighboring Chad with supposed Boko Haram envoy, Danladi Ahmadu. Shekau allegedly says in the video that he does not know Danladi.
Violence continues
Meanwhile, a triple bombing of a bus station in the city of Gombe on Friday killed at least eight people and wounded 41. It is not yet clear if the attacks were carried out by Boko Haram, though the group has targeted commuters in the past.

Thousands of Nigerians have been killed as a result of the Boko Haram uprising
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south.

1888,"Keen golfers can have their very own putting paradise if they snap up this luxury island previously owned by Tiger Woods.

The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was one of the homes shared by the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, before their six-year marriage fell apart in 2010.

The 62-acre island features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge, its very own landing strip for propeller planes as well as, of course, six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole.

Very private: The 62-acre island previously home to Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren

Riches: The island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden, was just one of the homes shared by golfer and his ex-wife

Secluded: The island's villa, built from wood cut from the island itself, according to the estate agents

Serene: The residence on the island is apparently the only home for many miles around

Rustic: Yet the wooden construction also includes modern conveniences like a hot tub and gas barbecue

Kitted out: The kitchen, including breakfast bar, wood-burning stove and a disguised extractor fan

Welcoming: The bedroom. Tiger Woods and his wife split after his infidelity became public

Room to live: The kitchen and living room share an open plan space with the wood ceiling rising high above

It also includes a protected quay, a private ferry boat, a historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnpälsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

But potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building comes unfurnished.

Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands, who are listing the island, told Mercury Press Agency: 'This island was owned by Tiger Woods but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

'This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy.

'It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

'Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice.

'The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

Log cabin: The hunting lodge offers another space away from the main house for times you want to be alone

Fore! The island includes six teeing off areas for a single custom golf hole

Neigh: These are the stables on the island which, along with the private pasture, would be great for horses

Well lit: As darkness falls, you can see the house is tastefully illuminated by a number of external lights

Is that an outside swimming pool? If so, it's an ambitious choice for Sweden, with its long, chilly winters...

A luxury yacht on the island: The protected quay catches the evening sun and it's only an hour's boat ride from the island to the Stockholm archipelago and the sights and sounds of the Swedish capital

Happy times: Tiger bought the place when married to Swede Elin

'Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

'A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

'This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to Mälaren's over 1000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.

'This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.

'The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake.

'The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion.

'The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.

'You go for a swim in Lake Mälaren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer.

'Apart from the island, the property also includes the two small Skinnpälsarna islands and a water area of around two million square metres.'

1890,"Federal officials have called a sitting U.S. Representative a liar after he went on national television claiming ISIS militants were crossing into the country through the Mexican border.

The Department of Homeland Security told AOL News that Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) was telling a tale Tuesday afternoon when he told Fox News that insurgents were traversing the Texas border.

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" spokesperson Marsha Catron told AOL.

""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Catron's comments came one day after Hunter ranted to host Greta van Susteren about America's pourous southern border.

""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter insisted. ""They aren't flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

""At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter added. ""There's nobody taking about it.""

When asked where he got the information, Hunter shot back that he ""asked the Border Patrol.""

An AOL News attempt to reach Texas Border Patrol officials was not successful. The inquiry was directed to the DHS.

""They caught them at the border,"" Hunter continued. ""Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border.

""If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""

Hunter's constituency mainly covers the San Diego area. He did not say if terrorists were also running through his neck of the woods.

When offered the opportunity to respond to DHS comments, a spokesperson for Rep Hunter provided AOL News a link to a blog claiming sources told it four ISIS terrorists have recently been arrested at the border.

There was no response to a follow up request for comment."
1891,"THERE are unconfirmed reports that jihadists fighting for the Islamic State have contracted Ebola.

Local media outlets reported that cases of Ebola have showed up at a hospital in the IS-controlled city of Mosul, in Iraq, Mashable reported.

Iraq’s official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, claimed that the disease had arrived in Mosul from jihadists “from several countries” including Africa.

An official told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus. Although the symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, can easily be mistaken for many other illnesses such as malaria.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been unable to confirm the cases.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable they were in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if help was needed investigating the cases.

1893,"A 31-year-old Canadian-Israeli woman who traveled to Iraq to join the Kurdish fight against the Islamic State group reportedly has been abducted by ISIS. Gill Rosenberg, 31, a former Israeli soldier, was captured after three suicide bombings near Kobani, the Times of Israel reported.

The SITE Intelligence Group said jihadists are discussing ideas for executing her or using her for a prisoner exchange. The capture was reported Sunday on the Islamic State-associated blog Samoach al-Islam and other Islamist websites. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it is investigating the claim, which was not backed by any evidence, the Jerusalem Post said. The Israeli security service Shin Bet told the Post it had “no further details” about the reported abduction.

The Canadian government said it is looking into the report, according to CTV News. The Department of Foreign Affairs told the media outlet in an email it was “pursuing all appropriate channels” in seeking to determine Rosenberg's whereabouts, but declined to release any other information.

Quoting two Kurdish fighters, Israel Radio reported Rosenberg was not near Kobani.

The Post noted if the claim is true, it would make Rosenberg, who was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and moved to Israel in 2006, the first Western female to fall into the Islamic State group’s hands and her Israeli citizenship could complicate the situation even further. Steven Sotloff, who was executed by ISIS in August, had dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship."
1895,"ISIS fighters have fired a crude chemical weapon at the Kurdish forces defending the Syria-Turkey border town of Kobane, it has been reported.

BBC reporter Güney Yıldız says a Kurdish official from the war-torn town told him of a suspected IS chemical attack last night, which has caused people to lose their eyesight, blistering on the skin and respiratory problems.

Testing on victims has not taken place because of the intensity of the fighting there, but a Kurdish doctor in the town, who was also injured by the strike, says he is '75 per cent' sure it is a chemical weapon.

There was also speculation it was an unsophisticated warhead containing chlorine, similar to weapons used in the First World War.

Last week the Iraqi government reported that ISIS controls a vast compound in Iraq containing 2,500 rusting chemical weapons rockets.

The site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of.

However, Iraqi officials wrote to the United Nations this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing the lethal nerve agent Sarin are still in the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s, and that this is now in the hands of the violent jihadists.

They warned that they had watched equipment there being looted on CCTV.

Militants then shut the surveillance cameras at the depot down, the New York Times reported.

Iraq's UN Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim wrote to the UN saying that 'armed terrorist groups' took over the Muthanna complex, which lies 60 miles north of Baghdad, on June 11.

In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there.

'The project management spotted at dawn on Thursday, 12 June 2014, through the camera surveillance system, the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances, before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system,' Alhakim wrote in the letter dated June 30.

'The Government of Iraq requests the States Members of the United Nations to understand the current inability of Iraq, owing to the deterioration of the security situation, to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons,' he said.

The Muthanna complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year.

Secrets: In 2002 President George W. Bush said Hussein was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found

Alhakim singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad in the notorious 'Sunni Triangle.'

The last major report by U.N. inspectors on the status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in March 2003. It states that Bunker 13 contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun.'

However, U.S. Defence Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said earlier that the United States' best understanding was that 'whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now'.

'We aren't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point,' Kirby said. 'Should they even be able to access the materials, frankly, it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else.'

It was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion but the Pentagon chose to keep the findings top secret.

An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that U.S. forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads, shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011.

But the information wasn't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were U.S.-made, plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore didn't support President George W. Bush's rationale for going to war.

The weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets - were developed by Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war which raged between 1980 and 1988.

But on September 12, 2002, President Bush had contended that Hussein was developing new chemical weapons capable of 'mass destruction'.

'Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons,' he said. But all the weapons found had been developed before 1991.

In March 2003, President Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441.

With strong support from British P.M. Tony Blair, the Bush administration claimed that Sadam and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to U.S. security and that of allies including the U.K. and Australia.

After investigation following the invasion, the U.S. led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion, but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted.

Although no active chemical weapons program was found, at least 17 U.S. troops and 7 Iraqi police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded.

President Bush later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was 'the intelligence failure' in Iraq, while the Senate Intelligence Committee found in 2008 that his administration 'misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from Iraq'.

The U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel in December 2011, during the ninth year of the war.

The rise of ISIS means that the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group.

Another reason for the cover-up, according to The Times, was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the U.S.

'''Nothing of significance'' is what I was ordered to say,' said Jarrod Lampier, a now-retired Army major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war.

Soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load.

Chemical warfare specialists had to be called in, and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions.

'I could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear, or I could just make it disappear myself,' one ex-soldier told The Times.

The mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated.

However, handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries, which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time.

Many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals, believing them to be regular old artillery.

At least 17 American military personnel and seven Iraqi police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases.

Many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation, exposing the soldiers to the potentially-lethal fumes.

Symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge, seething blisters.

Jarrod Taylor, a former Army sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company, joked of 'wounds that never happened' from 'that stuff that didn't exist'.

'I love it when I hear, ''Oh there weren't any chemical weapons in Iraq'',' he said. 'There were plenty.'"
1896,"Boko Haram has reportedly agreed to a cease-fire with the Nigerian military as well as the release of hundreds of schoolgirls who were abducted by the terrorist group earlier this year, officials said Friday. The jihadist militia has not yet made a public statement about the decision, which could confirm the arrangement, according to the BBC.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic."" The announcement of the release and cease-fire comes after a month of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians in 2014 alone.

The little-known al Qaeda offshoot gained national attention in April when they abducted some 300 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, to be sold as slaves. The abduction sparked international outrage and the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls that enlisted the likes of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and countless celebrities. Human rights organizations are watching the ongoing deals closely for any developments.

In August, Boko Haram declared an “Islamic state” in northeastern Nigeria, the Washington Post reported. Authorities believe the group is hiding the girls somewhere in that area. Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home.

“With hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,” Cooke told Time. “In some cases, there’s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process. And the longer they’re there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down.”

It's unclear how the girls have been treated during their captivity, raising questions about their health. “These girls are being held under absolutely horrific circumstances, subjected to sexual violence and rape, forced into servitude,” Cooke said. “There are reports that some have become pregnant.”"

1898,"Amidst all the fist-pumping and Bono-goofing yesterday, one piece of information was conspicuously absent: The Apple Watch's battery life. What's the point of strapping a tiny computer to your body if it needs constant charging? According to Re/code, even Apple hasn't quite figured out the battery dilemma yet.

After Tim Cook mentioned charging Apple Watch ""every night"" on stage, John Paczkowski confirms today that a source within Apple pins the charge-by date at nightly—which would imply that the Apple Watch has a battery life of less than a day. Apparently, Apple is still working to improve that number before release. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,"" an Apple spokesperson told Paczkowski, seemingly confirming the source.

This isn't just Apple's problem. As a paradigm, smartwatches still have quite a few kinks that need working out before they'll seem truly functional—and battery life is one of the biggest. On Monday, Gizmodo's Brent Rose reported that the Moto 360's battery life, while not as bad as expected, was only about 24 hours.

That's not terrible, but it does present some problems from a user experience perspective. The main selling point of many smartwatches is that they will constantly track your activity, from sleeping to working out. If your device needs to be charged for even a few hours every day, that's lost data, as information designer Nicholas Felton pointed out yesterday on Twitter:

Also sad that the watch charging solution means unbroken health stats are impossible. Not necessary for everyone, but important for many.

Sure, not everyone cares about tracking things like REM cycles. Not everyone will mind taking off their watch for a few hours every day. But the ideal use case for Apple Watch, just like a regular watch, is effortless omnipresence. It should just work—and for periods of time longer than 12 hours. [Re/code]"
1899,"An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

1900,"He’s being called a hero for shooting a rampaging gunman dead on Parliament Hill — and it may mark the first time Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers has ever fired a gun in the line of duty.

“This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone,” said Erin, Vickers’ niece.

A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary, 58-year-old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons: a grey-haired man in a black hat and robes, often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder.

On Tuesday, Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is, the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes…” Tweeted Minister Peter MacKay.

Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs, added his own Tweet of gratitude.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”

After the shooting, Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay,” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow, having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time.

“We’re always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today,” said Mary, Vicker’s older sister.

“He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall, before gunfire suddenly erupts, with dozens of shots echoing in the distance.

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator, a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before.

Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job.

“It’s not ceremonial at all, and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well,” said Mary.

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years, Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta, and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa.

After retiring from the force, he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill, and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons.

His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm, gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm.

“He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion,” she said.

“He’s a very capable human being.”

After being pressured into an eggnog-chugging contest at an office party, a Utah man nearly died from an infection that started in his lungs.

A YouTube video shows triumphant Ryan Roche down a carton of eggnog in a record 12 seconds, shattering the previous record of 22 seconds. For his victory, he received a gift card to a local steak house - and a trip to the hospital.

Roche told the Daily News he was actually about to leave the Dec. 10 holiday soiree with his family when the organizers broke out the eggnog.

A colleague called him out, and the competitive Roche refused to walk away.

Without even sparing time to taste it, the sales manager finished the quart of eggnog in record time -- but Roche said he immediately knew there was a problem.

The Lehi resident had done other chugging competitions in the past without incident, but as soon as this one ended, he couldn't breathe. In the video, he's seen bending over after finishing the drink.

Afterward, he coughed a lot and had trouble breathing as the thick holiday drink blocked his airways.

A few hours later he decided to go to the hospital.

""Initially I felt very nauseous and pretty sick,"" he said. ""After I was put on antibiotics and an IV I was no longer nauseous.""

But Roche spent three full days in the hospital. Because he'd breathed in the eggnog, the liquid caused an infection in his lungs.

""The next few days my body would change from having a fever to shivering nonstop,"" he said. ""It was like every hour on the hour it would change.""

About a week after being discharged from the hospital, Roche said he was back to full strength and feeling good.

His unusual illness also made him a celebrity inside the hospital.

""I can't tell you how many doctors or nurses would walk into my room and say, 'Eggnog, huh?' Then they'd say, 'Well, at least you won,'"" he said.

And the experience has not completely soured him on eggnog.

""I was never a big fan of it to begin with,"" he said. ""I could drink it again, but it's not my drink of choice.""

And though he is proud of his record, Roche said he will not be defending his title at future parties.

""No chance,"" he said. ""Even if someone challenged me to do it, my wife wouldn't allow it.""

1905,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES"
1906,"LONDON -- A pickup truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas has somehow found its way to the front lines of Syria's civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft weapon for Islamic militants.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.

Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.

The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.

They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.

Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.

The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.

Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.

It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who has an estimated net worth of $40 (£26) million and has 50 million followers worldwide, is head of the socio-spiritual organisation Dera Sacha Sauda. He also stars in films.

And the preacher allegedly convinced up to 400 men to carry out castrations on themselves because it would bring them closer to God.

The procedures, which witnesses say were conducted at a hospital owned by Singh, took place around the year 2000 but are coming to light because those involved are speaking out for the first time, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Singh was charged with conspiracy involving the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and several female followers claim he sexually assaulted them but he has never been convicted.

The current case was brought by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, who accuse Singh of grievous bodily harm.

1911,"In the days leading up to Apple's big event next week, which is rumored to be focused on the Apple Watch, a new detail about the company's first wearable has been leaked.  Along with all other features mentioned during Tim Cook's unveiling of the smartwatch in September, the device will also come with a feature called Power Reserve, according to The New York Times.

The report, which cites an anonymous Apple employee, claims that the unannounced feature will allow the watch operate in a mode that only shows the current time on its display, presumably to preserve battery power for other functions.

A standby mode for a wearable isn't particularly innovative, but given the questions surrounding the battery life of the Apple Watch (about a day, according to Apple), a Power Reserve feature dedicated to preserving battery life could be the device's saving grace. (Particularly when figures like $5,000 are being tossed around the rumor mill as the price for the top tier model.)

Another surprising detail revealed in the report is that during field testing of the Apple Watch, engineers disguised the device with a fake casing to make it look like a Samsung smartwatch. So if you've seen Apple employees walking around with what looks like a Samsung Gear and wondered why, you now have an answer to the mystery.

That last detail will probably come as a surprise to Samsung, a company often accused of following Apple's lead when it comes to mobile devices. But it also highlights the fact that Apple is entering a space already packed with smartwatches, so the success of the Apple Watch isn't a foregone conclusion, solid battery life or not.

1912,"Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered.”

Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information about developments in the case from authorities.

“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.

Separately, a group of students and relatives of the missing young people said they planned to march Sunday from Aytozinapa Normal school to the state capital of Chilpancingo to demand information in the case.

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.” He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.

State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.

In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.

During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack."
1913,"A blast near the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua on Saturday night was most likely caused by a meteorite plummeting to Earth, creating a 40-foot-wide crater.

A piece of the 2014 RC asteroid that passed close to Earth on Sunday, the meteorite dug a 16-foot-deep hole, Nicaraguan government scientists said. Miraculously, no one was hurt.

The 60-foot-wide asteroid was passing 25,000 miles from Earth on Sunday but posed no danger to the planet, NASA said.

Authorities have yet to determine whether the meteorite is buried or whether it disintegrated when it hit the ground. At first, locals believed the blast was caused by an earthquake, a regular occurrence in the country, Reuters said.

“All the evidence that we’ve confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,” said Jose Millan of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies.

The explosion on the outskirts of Managua, near the city’s airport, took place at around 11 p.m. and left a crater the size of a house.

“It could have come off that asteroid because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” said Humberto Garcia, a Nicaraguan volcanologist.

Calling it a “fascinating event,” Nicaragua’s first lady, Rosario Murillo, said the country would work with the U.S. Geological Service to find out more about what happened, The Daily Telegraph said."
1916,"On the same day Michael Brown Jr. was laid to rest, CNN Monday broadcast an audio recording in which the gunshots that felled the 18-year-old Aug. 9 can purportedly be heard in the background.

The recording was taken by an unidentified local who was engaged in, and recording, another discussion at the time of the shooting, the man’s attorney Lopa Blumenthal told CNN.

The outlet’s Don Lemon said that “CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape,” noting that they “reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording.”

PHOTOS: Most Shocking ‘Not Guilty’ Verdicts

Paul Ginsberg, an expert on audio forensics, said he heard 10 shots on the recording, first a series of six, then four more.

Blumenthal said the pause between the sixth and seventh shots fired could figure as key evidence into the ongoing investigation of the incident.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” Blumenthal, said the FBI has perused the recordings, told CNN. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson, triggering more than a week of rioting in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, and bringing race relations to the forefront of the country’s consciousness. Wilson’s actions in the deadly incident remain under scrutiny from both a grand jury and federal investigators.

Brown, who recently graduated high school, was buried Monday at St. Louis’ Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in a closed casket funeral attended by more than 4,500 people including the Rev. Al Sharpton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee, Sean Combs and Trayvon Martin’s parents.

“We’re not anti-police — we respect police,” Sharpton said at the proceedings. “But those police that are wrong need to be dealt with just like those in our community that are wrong need to be dealt with.”

Politicians such as Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill and Rep. William Lacy Clay also were in the pews on the somber day.

1917,"Apple originally planned for the Apple Watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features, but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this April, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.

The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist.

Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation.

Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to add them back in future versions of the device, though.

Elsewhere in its article, The Journal says the Apple Watch was known at Apple by the name ""black hole"" because it kept drawing in more and more resources. Development of the device reportedly took over four years."
1918,"MEXICO CITY — Rumors about the death of Fidel Castro — an age-old ritual for Cuba-watchers — once again began circulating on and off the island this week.

It’s true that Castro hasn't been seen in public in about a year, and it’s been a few months since one of his last columns were published. Castro, 88, has not said one public word about the historic announcement by President Obama last month about his goal of moving toward normal relations with Cuba after a half-century Cold War stand-off.

Twitter went wild Thursday night with speculation about his demise. Why? There are rumors about that, too. One of them is that another Fidel Castro, this one the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died a few days ago (Fidel Castro Odinga of Nairobi), and maybe this was all a social media mash-up of mistaken identity.

Also, an Argentine Web site reported that foreign press in Havana had been summoned to a news conference — presumably to announce the huge news — but this turned out to be false. On the island, there was more talk this morning that Fidel’s brother, current President Raul Castro, would be speaking today at noon, but that came and went in silence.

Instead, Cuban state media has been promoting a round-table interview with the three members of the “Cuban 5” who were released from U.S. custody as part of the prisoner swap.

The Cuban government hasn’t spoken one way or the other about Fidel Castro’s health in recent days."
1920,"Amid legalization drive in states across the country

New York City officials are considering issuing tickets for possession of small amounts of marijuana instead of arresting people, officials said.

The new guidelines would allow people with low-level marijuana possession to be issued a court summons rather than requiring them to get handcuffed, arrested, and brought into the precinct for finger-printing, the New York Times reports.

Police arrested some 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges during the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Numerous states and localities have decriminalized marijuana for medical or recreational use in recent years.

1921,"The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

This video proves that a person's integrity goes far beyond what meets the eye.

In a video uploaded to YouTube, prankster Josh Paler Lin gives $100 to a homeless man and secretly follows the him to find out how it's spent.

The homeless man is seen on camera buying food and giving it to strangers in the park. The sight turns Lin's perception of homelessness on its head.

Lin says he is ""stunned"" and admits he thought the man might buy alcohol.

""You just touched my heart,"" Lin told him.

While the gesture left the prankster so emotional that he decided to donate another $100, he also had something to offer Lin:

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance,"" the homeless man told him. ""And they didn't go homeless because they're lazy ...It could be a divorce, and one thing leads to another. A man sells his boat, his home, and all of a sudden he finds out he has no money. There's a lot of good people that are homeless.""

Update: Taugan Tan Kadalim, a passerby to the scene, told Vocativ that he witnessed some of the filming of the video and that the incident appeared to be staged. Kadalim told the site that Lin and the homeless man arrived at the liquor store in the same car. In response, Lin told HuffPost that Vocativ's allegation is ""false.""

1923,"Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's ""spiderman"" might not be all it seemed.

Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.

Earlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing ""a really burning sensation like a searing feeling"" in his abdomen.

Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.

Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a ""tropical spider"".

But it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was ""almost impossible"" for the culprit to have been a spider.

""If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,"" he said.

""We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.""

Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case ""bizarre"".

""I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,"" he said.

""Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.

""Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.""

Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.
""We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,"" he said.

""None of those are true, they're just made up stories.

""They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.""

Something which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do ""live on humans"".

""We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,"" he said.

""They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.""

Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.

""It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,"" he said.

""If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.""

Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.

1925,"YouTuber Josh Paler Lin – better-known for his hilarious pranks – was feeling the holiday spirit and decided to give a homeless man in California $100 to see what he would do with it. 

He followed the man, Thomas, with a camera to see how he spent the money. His first stop was a liquor store, but not for the reasons some might think: He bought bread and then headed over to a park, where Lin filmed him distributing the food to other homeless people. 

When Lin approached him at the park, Thomas explained his story. He quit his job to take care of his sick parents, only to lose his home after his parents died within two weeks of each other. He's been on the streets for four months. 

""I feel I owe you an apology,"" Lin told Thomas after hearing his story. 




Thomas explained that he simply wanted to use the money to help others in his situation. Lin gave him another $100 and has even started a crowdfunding campaign to help buy Thomas clothes, food and get him on the road to a job. He's already surpassed his $10,00 goal and raised over $60,000. 

""There are things money can't buy and I get happiness out of what I'm doing,"" Thomas told Lin.

1926,"NBC's lead anchor defended the meteorologist and explained that he had lost contact with the control room and was trying to call them with his cellphone. Seidel was unknowingly placed on live television Saturday night while his back was turned to the camera, fueling the incorrect rumors.

After hundreds of mentions on social media the past two days, NBC News anchor Brian Williams slammed those who speculated they caught meteorologist Mike Seidel relieving himself live on air and said they owe him an apology.

The anchor for the network's “Nightly News” program chose to squash the Internet rumors on Monday's broadcast that Seidel was caught ""writing his name on the snow"" when reporting from a major snowstorm in North Carolina Saturday.

""Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,” Williams declared.

On Saturday’s broadcast, anchor Lester Holt said they were going to the station's No. 1 meteorologist for a report.

Seidel appeared to be, well, a wee bit busy, as his back was turned to the camera and he was slightly hunched forward. A few seconds after he was introduced he could be heard asking ""Why?"" and then turned around and put on his gloves.

The strange television blooper from Sugar Mountain, N.C., fueled speculation that he was relieving himself behind some trees.

The segment also led to some teasing for the weather professional.

But the speculation was incorrect and Williams wanted to make sure his audience of about 8 million nightly viewers knew the real story.

He then explained Seidel had lost cellphone contact with the control room and couldn't hear through his attached earpiece, he didn't know he was on the air and took off his gloves so he could call them with his phone that was tethered to his ear. His phone had lost its signal, a network spokesman told the Daily News.

""That's when the rumors hit the Web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,"" Williams said. ""It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.""

A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing http://t.co/MoogDLa3z1""

Seidel tweeted the video of Williams' statement Monday night with a thank you to his anchor.

""A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing,"" he tweeted.

Of course, it was seeing Seidel’s back that started this whole thing.

1931,"There are conflicting claims about ISIS being at the border, but there are reasons not to trust reporting that the claim is false."
1933,"At least not anytime soon

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

Only yesterday, Ben & Jerry's said they'd be up for creating cannabis-infused ice-cream once it's completely legal.

Update: KFC confirmed it. Not happening."
1934,"New audio has surfaced that allegedly captures the moment when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on Aug. 9.

CNN aired the unverified recording on Monday night. Six shots can be heard, followed by a pause, then several more. A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head.

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.

Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the street and were stopped by Wilson. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and said that Wilson was injured after the altercation. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Aug. 15 that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen, though Jackson later said that Wilson ""made the connection"" during the course of the stop. The family's attorney accused police of trying to ""assassinate the character of Michael Brown"" to divert attention from his death."
1936,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was attacked in prison and left blinded and paralyzed, a satirical website claimed in a story that quickly went viral this weekend.

On Saturday, the site Empire News posted a story claiming that the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was found lying in a pool of blood in his cell in Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts. The story made the rounds on the internet, with thousands of shares on Facebook and other social media and many welcoming the news.

But there is one problem — the incident never happened, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still safe in his cell awaiting trial. Though the story fooled many, others noted that Empire News is a site dedicated entirely to satire, like a lesser known version of The Onion.

Those who browsed the site a bit found that out. Empire News has posted other stories including “Former Vice President Al Gore Arrested For Indecent Exposure,” and “It’s Official: New York Jets Moving To Los Angeles, Construction Of Los Angeles Stadium Begins.”

The details of the story itself gave readers reason for doubt.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

The story went on to say that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was actually attacked in prison by members of the Aryan Nation prison gang.

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

While Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not attacked in prison, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect could still be killed for his crimes. He may face the death penalty if convicted."
1938,"An 85-year-old woman in Waco, Texas has been been arrested for allegedly kidnapping neighbor’s cats and making them into fur coats.

Local residents couldn’t figure out where their cats were disappearing, so one or more residents decided to hire a private investigator. Some even thought they saw their own cats as a part of her fur coats. Eventually, the investigator successfully videotaped the woman stealing a neighbor’s cat.

According to World News Daily Report, the woman admitted in court that she tried to raise her own cats, but became too attached to them.

Prior to being caught on tape, the woman denied all allegations.

Prosecutors allege that the retired fashion designer skinned the cats in her basement. The following is a photo of the woman wearing one of her fur coats:

Investigators estimate that a total of 30 coats were required to make a single jacket. Additionally, they report that 20 skinned cats were found at the crime scene.

If found guilty, the unnamed woman could spend up to 18 months in prison."
1939,"British man suspected of appearing in videos of hostages being beheaded

The British Isis militant suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages has been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi from London.

The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming the masked man known as Jihadi John, who spoke in the videos with a British accent.

Emwazi, believed to be aged 27, was known to MI5 as a ""person of interest"" in 2011, according to the BBC. It reports that his name was not revealed at an earlier stage for ""operational reasons"".

One of Emwazi's friends was quoted by The Post as saying: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.""

The Post claims that Emwazi is from an affluent family in west London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming. It says he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and later joined Isis.

An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said there was an ""extremely strong resemblance"", between the militant in the videos and Emwazi. Mr Qureshi says he was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria.

Foley's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists, all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black, believed to be Jihadi John.

He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed by the extremist group.

The name 'Jihadi John' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John' during their time captive.

Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised after a trip he planned to Tanzania. He and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabaab operates.

Mr Qureshi says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Mr Qureshi told The Post.

The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait, his birthplace, and returned to London twice before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain, who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings.

He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait, telling Mr Qureshi in an email: “I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, but now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.""

Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice. He felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions"", according to Mr Qureshi.

One friend said he believed Emwazi had wanted to teach English in Saudi Arabia but had been unsuccessful shortly before he disappeared.

“He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out,"" the friend was quoted as saying.

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The Home Office said it would neither confirm nor deny reports at this stage."
1940,"A hoax report filed by website nationalreport.net claimed the infamous artist had been arrested in London during a raid on his art studio.

The website – which describes itself as ""America's No.1 independent news source"" – said a man named Paul Horner from Liverpool had been nicked.

To complete the tale they quoted ""London police chief"" Lyndon Edwards who apparently held a press conference to announce the arrest. A press conference apparently attended by no reporters or TV crews.

HOAX: The false report claiming Banksy had been arrested [NATIONALREPORT]
Most hilariously of all the article was written by one Darius Rubics who has ""won numerous awards for journalism including a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize"".

Despite the ludicrous nature of the article some fell for it hook, line and sinker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch, never shy of sharing her opinion with the world, said: ""You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy?

""There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?""

She did later apologise after being duped.


There are so many problems with the hoax we've decided to list some of the best ones for you.

– The article claims Banksy is from Liverpool when all known evidence strongly suggests he is from Bristol.

– Other articles by Darius Rubics include: Dennis Rodman leaves US to talk with leaders of ISIS and Obama declares November national Muslim appreciation month.

– London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards doesn't exist. The top cop in London is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

– The article suggests Banksy was nicked in Watford which actually falls under the catchment of the Hertfordshire Police.

– In Britain police do not release mugshots of people after they have been arrested.

– Banksy's PR Jo Brooks, despite apparently being quoted in the original story, has tweeted saying it is a hoax."
1943,"A man rushed to a Kansas City-area hospital Saturday is not being treated for Ebola, hospital officials say.

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of E. Meyer Blvd. was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas."

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named — making it difficult to verify."
1948,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken."
1949,"There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work."
1950,"Mounted with a cannon and leaving a trail of shells in its wake, a black pickup truck in the hands of jihadists in Syria has brought woe to a family of Texas City plumbers by way of the insignia on its driver-side door: “Mark-1 Plumbing”.

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen, a sometime ally of Islamic State (Isis) and al-Nusra fighters, tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo. Since then, Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats.

Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family, who own Mark-1 Plumbing, reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line. On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified: “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.” His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news: “We had no intentions or idea that this would happen.”

“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror – it’s crazy. Never in my life would I think something like that,” the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU.

The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation, confirmed Marc Cannon, senior vice-president of AutoNation’s corporate communications. Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston.

The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer, though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer. An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls, and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo.

From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers’ old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer. The truck then likely passed through Turkey’s porous border, which lies only a few hours’ drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas.

About erasing the logo, the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen “were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it”. The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers “are really ugly”.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families,” his son told KHOU. “We have nothing to do with terror at all.”

His father had a message to the broader world: “I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth.”

A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo. The person said that sold vehicles would “most definitely” have the logo removed henceforth.

Auction houses, which make more profit the faster they turn products, usually sell used cars quickly, and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots. Those exporters then ship used cars into the sizeable market in developing nations, where a battered Ford can find a long second life, or where scavengers can resurrect a lemon or dismantle it for parts."

1956,"Islamic State fighters fed the mum cooked meat and rice before telling her it was the remains of her kidnapped son, a British dad who went to fight IS has revealed

Sick ISIS militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son - after telling her it was cooked meat and rice, it was claimed today.

The son had been captured and taken prisoner by Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq.

The worried mum then bravely visited the terror group's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one.

ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, after giving the mother cooked meat, rice and soup, she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son.

British dad Yasir Abdulla, who left his home in Keighley, West Yorkshire to fight against ISIS, said he joined the battle against the terror group after being told this story.

He said: ""The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just eaten him'.""

And after witnessing the horrors of the terror group up close, Yasir says they have 'hijacked Islam'.

""ISIS are wrong. They behead, burn and get those they are against do dig their own graves before they execute them,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to get captured by ISIS, that would be the worst thing. If I was defending I would fight to my last bullet and use that on myself.""

Yasir is aware of Brits joining ISIS but has not encountered any in battle. ""I have seen what Jihad John has done and I think that person needs to be captured and executed,"" he said.

""England is a lovely place, the people are lovely and the Government is good. Whatever the British joining ISIS say is wrong about Britain, they just hate.

""They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. Muslim people should not cut the head off an animal in front of another animal, but these ISIS behead people every day in front of other people.""

The incident is the latest atrocity from the terror group.

It emerged this weekend that Islamic State militants blindfolded a 'gay' man, threw him from a roof then stoned his corpse in Syria.

Horrific images revealed by ISIS show the barbaric killing in front of a baying crowd carried out at a building in Raqqa.

It is believed the man was sentenced to death by a sharia court.

The man was described as being a 'child of Lot' and accused of committing acts of sodomy, according to the Daily Mail.

'Lot' is a reference to a prophet of God whose story in the Qu'ran is used to demonstrate Islam's supposed disapproval of rape and homosexuality.

#ISIS stoned a man to death in Tal Abiad in #Raqqa for being homosexual after throwing him from the roof of the Islamic Court building.— الرقة تذبح بصمت (@Raqqa_Sl) February 27, 2015

The images appear to show the man was blindfolded and had his feet tied before being hurled onto rubble from a tall building.

Crowds then gather round and pelt the corpse with rocks.

It was the fourth time in a few weeks that the jihadist group has used the brutal execution method for alleged homosexuality .

After claiming they found videos on his mobile phone showing him 'practising indecent acts with males,' a 20-year old man was stoned to death in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in late November, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Fighters from group Libyan Dawn have posed for pictures with aircraft

U.S. officials warn planes could be used to carry out terror attacks on 9/11

September 11 also marks anniversary of attack on US embassy in Libya

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport. At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists, like Syria.

1959,"A man had his penis cut off by an angry mob for attempting to rape a teenager in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The incident took place after shocked members of the public saw the man in an alley, pinning a terrified girl to a wall.

  
(Representational Image).Reuters
The 40-year-old man, recognised as Suresh Kumar, soon found himself being dragged away by the hysteric mob while they decided to punish him in their own way, the Daily Star reported posting pictures of the incident and a severed penis thrown on the street.
The mob took the man to a local butcher shop, where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour. Thereafter, they hacked his penis off with a meat cleaver and dumped the severed organ in the middle of the street. The man -- bloodied, bruised and unconscious -- was abandoned with no one willing to show any mercy, the Daily Mirror reports.
The Daily Star online, which first reported the story with a censored photograph of the cut penis, claims that its reporters have seen the picture but could not show it due to its graphic nature.
""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"" the tabloid quoted a local man Aamir Dhawan as saying.
""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hanged, and molested, and it's time it stopped,"" he said adding that the incident sent out a strong message to people with perverted mindset.
The police have condemned the attack, warning locals not to take law into their hands and telling those people who cut the man's penis to hand themselves in.?
 

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice,"" one police officer was quoted as saying."
1965,"The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering, but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age. And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab-Israeli conflict. Not only will people believe anything about Israel; their editors will let them write it. And as we learned yesterday, pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel.”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion. Last year, the good folks at Vox, a notoriously error-ridden site, declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza. It was not a maddening mistake; it was, rather, kind of endearing. It was adorable, in its own way. But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact.

Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible. As was subsequently pointed out (and corrected accordingly), this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map.

And this week we were treated to another version of this story, though it’s one we hear often enough. It’s a bit of a hazing ritual: the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold. The lie is this: that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South. Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams. They are the Gaza-West Bank bridge of this story. And yet, the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers.

One of the suckers this year was Vice News. To try to hide its ignorance, Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”: “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday.”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel. As HonestReporting notes, the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also, crucially, added a straight correction and admission of error: “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country, causing flooding in the Gaza strip. In fact, there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues. We are happy to clarify this.”

According to HonestReporting, the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence: “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities.”

And according to CAMERA, both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera (shocking, I know) passed along the flood libel. AFP pulled its video, and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute.

The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes. See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising. IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox:


So why does this keep happening? Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness. The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach, and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel, the facts are optional. And that’s because the facts favor Israel.

If you were to draw a map of Israel, using Western news organizations’ reporting, you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv. None of that is true, but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting.”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work. These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda. But they also seem not to mind, because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them.

If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist, not a journalist, well–that’s about right. And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti-Semitic mill. The first headline is the one that makes waves, especially in the Arab world and in Europe. If the follow-up is not a full retraction or correction, but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist, then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover-up.

It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right. But that’s naïve. The truth is, much of the time our media just won’t get it right. And that’s why the flood libel returns, year after year."

1967,"Palestinian officials say hundreds of Gazans were forced to evacuate after Israel opened the gates of several dams on the border with the Gaza Strip, and flooded at least 80 households. Israel has denied the claim as “entirely false.”

In the wake of a recent severe winter storm in the region, Israeli authorities opened the floodgates to discharge the accumulated water, Palestinian officials say. Residents of eastern Gaza reported injuries as well as deaths of livestock and poultry, caused by the Israeli action which allegedly came without prior notification, Gaza's Civil Defense Directorate (CDD) said Sunday.

Photos of the Gaza Strip flood have appeared in social networks, but the date when they were taken can't be independently verified as yet.


“The [Israeli] army opened the floodgates of a canal leading to central Gaza, which resulted in the removal of sand mounds along the border with Israel,” the CDD announced, according to Palestinian News Agency WAFA.

“Opening the levees to the canal has led to the flooding of several Palestinian homes, and we had to quickly evacuate the afflicted citizens.”

No casualties were reported as a result, but more than 80 families had to flee after their homes filled with water levels sometimes reaching more than three meters, the Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement.

In a letter to RT regarding the issue, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) maintained that“the claim is entirely false.""

""Southern Israel does not have any dams. Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel,” COGAT said.

The flood reportedly forced the closure of the main road connecting al-Mughraqa district and Nusseirat refugee camp south of Gaza city, leaving hundreds of Palestinians trapped in the floods, a difficult prospect for approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel’s assault last summer.

Evacuated families were taken to UNRWA-sponsored (UN Relief and Works Agency) shelters in the al-Bureij refugee camp and the al-Zahra neighborhood.


""Israel opened water dams, without warning, last night, causing serious damage to Gazan villages near the border. More than 40 homes were flooded and 80 families are currently in shelters as a result,” chief of the civil defense agency in Gaza, Brigadier Gerneral Said Al-Saudi, told Al Jazeera.

Local agriculture was also affected, Al-Saudi said. “We are appealing to human rights organizations and international rights organizations to intervene to prevent further such action.”

Further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams, warned Gaza Civil Defense Services (CDD) spokesman Muhammad al-Midana, as cited by the Ma'an news agency. A fast-moving water stream is currently flowing from the Israel border through the Gaza valley and into the Mediterranean Sea, he said.


The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) used to be a unique wetland ecosystem located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It flowed from two streams, one running from near Beersheba, and the other from vicinity of Hebron. There’s not much water left in Wadi Gaza, as water being mostly used upstream in Israel and the stream running through the Gaza Strip consists mainly of untreated waste from Gaza City, which pumps up millions of liters of sewage into the riverbed.

According to media reports, this is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the floodgates to their Gaza Valley dams to discharge massive quantities of excessive water that accumulated during heavy rains or snowfall."

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

1971,"HUNTINGTON BEACH (CBSLA.com)  —  The viral video of a homeless man buying food for friends with $100 he had been given warmed the hearts of many of the more than 25 million people who clicked on it.
Donations came pouring in for the homeless man named Thomas. More than $130,000 donated from around the globe in about a week.
Josh Paler Lin, the YouTube personality who uploaded the nearly five-minute video, is telling everyone within earshot that the heartwarming viral video is real.
The homeless man’s brother, however, said that his brother is being scammed. Meanwhile, an eyewitness to the filming also believes the entire thing is a hoax.
The eyewitness told CBS2’s Stacey Butler that he saw Thomas in Lin’s car when Lin purported the man didn’t know he was being filmed. During the video, Lin can be heard telling his shooter, “Make sure he doesn’t see you.”
The homeless man’s brother also spoke to Butler.
In the video,  the homeless man is tracked to a convenience store that sold liquor. He buys food for other homeless people with the $100 he was given by Lin.
Lin later confronts the man and gives him another $100 because he said he assumed he was going to buy alcohol with the money and he couldn’t believe he was so generous with his friends.
In another eight-minute video, Lin takes Thomas out for a couple of meals, including shabu-shabu on Christmas Eve, provides him with a hotel room and a surprise makeover. Lin insists none of the videos were staged or scripted.
With hits to his YouTube channel (he joined in 2009), it’s already estimated that Lin made $52,000, not counting the Indiegogo fundraising  page he said he set up for Thomas. Lin’s channel also gained him nearly 15,000 new fans.
Critics have already pointed out that Thomas would have had to have walked  for at least 34 minutes to the Liquor Mart, passing cheaper supermarkets along the way. They also point out that a homeless and begging Thomas had a rather blase reaction for someone who had just received $100 from a stranger.
The eyewitness to the filming told Butler he knew Lin from his many prankster videos and said he definitely saw Thomas in Lin’s vehicle during set-ups.
“I was there,” says Taugan Kadalim, “they didn’t ‘follow’ him. They drove him there [to the liquor store.]
Kadalim believes Thomas, 56, is really homeless but that the entire video was staged.
“I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful,” Kadalim says, “And dishonest.”
Thomas’ brother, Kevin Nickel, reached out to CBS2.
“This isn’t right,” he said.
“In a surprising twist,” Butler reported, “he says his brother’s real name is Kenny Nickel. He said his brother is an alcoholic and lived with their parents until both died last summer.”
He said his brother was arrested for public intoxication and put in jail. Butler was unable to confirm his arrest record.
His brother also says Kenny is actually not broke. He is due $150,000 from his parents’ estate.
“He’s sitting on money,” Kevin said, not sure if his brother is even aware of the Indiegogo money being collected on his behalf. “But this is a scam. This money needs to go to people who really need it.”
Kevin fears his brother is being manipulated and that if he does get the money he uses it to get help."
1972,"Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, has become so fat while in office that his ankles have fractured under his own weight, it was reported on Tuesday.

The 31-year-old, who has looked increasingly portly since taking power, had to undergo a hospital operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a gruelling round of official engagements.

The treatment has also been linked to his unexpected failure to attend a recent session of the Supreme People's Assembly, according to a Pyongyang source who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper in neighbouring South Korea.

Unlike other members of North Korea's political elite, for whom a sudden absence from public life often means they have been killed or imprisoned, in Kim Jong-un's case it is said to be down to Elvis-style weight gain as a result of his unhealthy diet.

He is now believed to weigh at least 20 stone as a result of his fondness for heavy drinking and imported Swiss cheese, which he gained a taste for while at school in Switzerland.

His ankle injuries are said to have resulted from a long tour of military bases and factories while wearing shoes decked out with Cuban heels, which boosted his 5ft 9ins height but proved difficult to walk in. He is said to have suffered sprains on both feet first and then compounded the injuries by walking more, leading to the fractures.

Bodyguards have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he is now being treated. ""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" said the source. There was also speculation that a team of private European doctors had flown in to treat him.

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state television which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill."
1973,"(ANTIMEDIA) The KFC Corporation just acquired a Colorado licence to legally sell cannabis within the state.
According to some reports, nearly half of the KFC franchises in the state Colorado began selling cannabis last month.
“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success. It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado,” KFC spokesperson William Rausch said in a statement.

 
Customers who want to buy cannabis with their genetically modified fried chicken will still need to prove that they are at least 21 years of age, with a valid government issued ID.
Interestingly enough, this weird phenomenon is something that “South Park” predicted years ago. In one episode of the hit comedy show, Randy Marsh gives himself testicular cancer with a microwave in order to get a prescription for medical marijuana. In the episode, all of the KFC locations in the town become marijuana dispensaries.
With this bold move, KFC becomes one of the first major fast food chains to offer this extra service, and it is possible that many others will follow in their footsteps. Fast food has been suffering financially in recent years, as consumers become more health conscious. While KFC may not be the best place to eat, the addition of cannabis to their menu definitely signals the beginning of a new era."
1974,"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.

Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

Yesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said.

The action in Syria included 17 strikes near the cities of Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani. A variety of Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units were hit.

In Iraq, 12 strikes targeted Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units near the cities of Mosul, Fallujah and Sinjar.

Fighters, bombs and remotely controlled aircraft were used."
1975,"Video clips circulated online Tuesday that purported to show that Saudi state television blurred out First Lady Michelle Obama at a meeting between President Barack Obama and the new Saudi king.

However, observers of the live broadcast — including a Wall Street Journal reporter in the country — said that there was no blurring of Mrs. Obama, and that the broadcast showed her shaking hands with King Salman.

The Saudi embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to Bloomberg View, the embassy’s information director said: “Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.” Various clips posted of the ceremony elsewhere show no blurring of Mrs. Obama or of her handshake with the new king.

The Obamas made a stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday on their way back from India to pay respects to the late King Abdullah and to meet with the new leader of a longtime American ally. The visit came amid continued criticism of Saudi Arabia’s policies regarding women’s rights, which served to put the interactions between the first lady and Saudi officials under a spotlight.

Mrs. Obama dressed conservatively, with long pants and long sleeves. The first lady didn’t wear a headscarf in the conservative Muslim country — a standard part of Saudi Arabia’s state-mandated dress code. But covering the head isn’t required for foreigners, though only 3% of Saudis believe that a women without a headscarf is appropriately dressed in public, according to a 2014 study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.

Her appearance drew notice on Twitter. Social media users tweeted using an Arabic hashtag that translates to #MichelleObama_NotVeiled.


 


 

Others wondered why she had covered her head on a previous trip, to Indonesia. The photos used were from a 2010 visit to the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta.

1976,"Sources in the Kurdish underground in Syria denied Sunday night that Canadian-Israeli Gill Rosenberg, 31, had been in the Kobane region, as claimed by Islamist and Palestinian websites that reported she was captured by ISIS during the fighting in that area. The report about Rosenberg's capture has not been confirmed by ISIS.

An American who is fighting in the ranks of the Kurds told Voice of Israel that Rosenberg was not in the Kobane region. “She was never in Kobane, that's not reasonable that she was captured,” he said. The head of the station's foreign news desk, Eran Sikorel, said that he, too, had information that Rosenberg had been stationed in eastern Syria and not in the Kobane region, which is in central Syria. 

Yisrael Hayom quotes a senior Kurdish source who confirmed that Rosenberg joined the Kurdish resistance in Syria and said she was the first western woman to join its fighters. The source added that ten other western citizens who are not of Kurdish origin have also joined the Kurdish fighters in recent days.

Earlier on Sunday, the monitoring group SITE said Islamic State (ISIS) jihadists claimed a ""female Zionist soldier"" had been captured in the embattled Syrian border town.

Some jihadists said the woman might be Rosenberg, who had served in the Israel Defense Forces and had volunteered to fight with the Kurds, the monitoring group said.

""The Government of Canada is aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria,"" a foreign ministry statement said, according to AFP.

""Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and officials are in close contact with local authorities,"" added the statement.

Israel, too, said it was following reports about Rosenberg."
1978,"A Led Zeppelin reunion tour, backed by an astonishing amount of money put up by British billionaire Richard Branson, will never happen — because singer Robert Plant ripped up a contract that would have paid him about $300 million to play 35 concerts with the the legendary band in just three cities.

The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper, which said that the 66-year-old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do.”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

According to the Mirror story, the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, and 68-year-old bass player/musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega-contracts and were ready to set out on the tour, which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey.

But Plant just wasn’t into it.

Jason Bonham, the 48-year-old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid-1970s. But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge.

Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one-off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007. Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career.

Branson, according to the Mirror, guaranteed the band more than $900 million to be split among the three original members, for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour.

Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current, already-formidable net worth, which is reported at $170 million.

According to the Mirror’s source, Page, Jones, and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying. “There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Led Zeppelin fans can still get their dose of the legendary band through an ongoing series of remastered reissues of the original Led Zeppelin albums, a project being coordinated by Page."
1979,"Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perth’s King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning.
The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

The doctor who practiced the cesarean section first believed the woman to be pregnant with twins or even triplets.

“I have dealt with other women suffering from obesity before but this birth will stick with me until I die” he told reporters with a large grin. “I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there” he commented laughingly, “but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player” he added with humor.
The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighted 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839. The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 7’6 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday."
1981,"A man caught allegedly attempting to rape a teenage girl was set upon by a vigilante group who hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver.

These horrifying pictures show Suresh Kumar, 40, after he was beaten with sticks for an hour before being castrated in the city of Ganganagar in India.

He was then left bleeding in the road next to his penis and testicles. He was later taken to hospital in a ""critical"" condition.

The girl was treated for shock and is being given counselling.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.  ""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.  ""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

India has been plagued recently for a string of brutal sex attacks against women and public anger has swelled considerably following an number of high-profile cases.

Despite this, police have called for those responsible for the castration to come forward.

A police spokesman said: ""People cannot take the law into your own hands.  ""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them."
1982,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Al-Shabaab’s top leader was traveling in one of two vehicles hit Monday night in a US military strike, a member of the Somali Islamic extremist group said Tuesday.

The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed.

The two vehicles were heading toward the coastal town of Barawe, al-Shabaab’s main base, when they were hit, Abu Mohammed told the Associated Press. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions in the strike.

Al-Shabaab attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people, a year ago this month, and the US targeted planners of the bloody assault. US commanders were waiting to determine the attack’s outcome.

“US military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the US strike in a forest south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the US and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

“Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,” said Mohamed Ali, who lives in the Sablale district. “They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.”

A senior Somali intelligence official said a US drone targeted Godane as he left a meeting of the group’s top leaders. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. In 2012, the US offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

The Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, said intelligence indicated Godane “might have been killed along with other militants.” The official said the attack took place 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, where al-Shabaab trains its fighters.

As government and African Union forces were heading to a town in the district, they heard what sounded like an “earthquake” as the al-Shabaab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told the Associated Press.

“There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,” Nor said.

The US has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A US missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a US strike that killed al-Shabaab’s top explosives expert.

The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabaab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the attack was carried out in retaliation for the West’s support for Kenya’s Somalia intervention and the “interest of their oil companies.”

Al-Shabaab is now mostly active in Somalia’s rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting."
1983,"While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Either way, we have longer to wait before we find out more than we'd like. [iGen.fr via MacRumors]"

The student, Mohammed Islam, is profiled in this year’s edition of New York magazine’s annual treat, “Reasons to Love New York.” Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants, and he and a few other pint-size, hobbyist traders and poker players appear to have created a cool nerd gang for the ages—dining at Morimoto and Mari Vanna, where they toss back apple juice and caviar. They want to make a billion dollars next year (stay tuned). “But it’s not just about money,” Islam said. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers.”

One of Islam’s friends, whom the magazine describes as “the son of a Kazakh oligarch,” peppers the profile with references to The Wolf of Wall Street and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but Islam seems to have a decent head on his shoulders, Koch brothers identification notwithstanding.

1988,"American photojournalist Luke Somers, held by al-Qaeda militants following his abduction in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September last year, was killed during a failed rescue attempt early Saturday, according to his sister.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI. ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said. Lucy Somers gave the comments to the Associated Press.

The claim nonetheless seemed to contradict a statement on the Yemen defense ministry's website carried by Reuters that suggested Luke Somers had been freed following a suspected U.S. drone strike Saturday in Yemen that killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, according to an official who spoke to the AP. The official did not elaborate and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.

There was also no immediate comment from U.S. officials, who rarely discuss their drone campaign in Yemen.

Following the strike, the Al Arabiya news organization tweeted that ""reports suggest U.S. #journalists held in #Yemen freed,"" but there was no immediate confirmation of that report or the originating source.

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, says is certain his ""life is in danger.""

The video features an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers — dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head — at the end. He notes that he was born in England but has American citizenship and lived in America for most of his life.

2009,"Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba's former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the timing is suspiciously close to the death of another high-profile person who shares his name.

While reports of the death of Cuba's 88-year-old former leader could be true, there has been no official confirmation and his death has been mistakenly claimed on social media many times in the past.

Also casting doubt on today's rumours is the possibility it has been confused with the recent death of the son of Nairobi's opposition leader, named Fidel Castro Odinga, 41, who died only days ago.

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, pictured during a speech in 2003. Twitter is abuzz with rumours he has died, but it remains to be seen if they are correct

However, speculation is rife that the former leader of Cuba has died after Venezuelan media reports the Cuban Government has called for a press conference with the international media today. Venezuela and Cuba have fostered a close relationship for decades.

The report in the Diario de Cuba, didn't specify a time or subject for the press conference, saying that the Cuban government's press office wouldn't give out the information..

It has also been claimed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has rushed to Havana, adding some substance to the rumours that Castro's death could be announced.

Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to his brother Raul in 2008, was announced Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.
This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died  at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January. The young man’s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.
Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.
The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

One of Mark Oberholtzer's old work trucks appeared in a photo tweeted by a Syrian rebel group, prompting an influx of threatening phone calls to the plumber.

His truck, with its original decal for ""Mark 1 Plumbing"" and a phone number for the business, is reportedly being used by the militant group to transport an anti-aircraft gun.

The original tweet, below, was posted to an account associated with the Jabhat Ansar al-Din militant group based in Syria. Oberholtzer traded in his truck to a Texas dealership that then placed it up for auction in 2013.

""We had no intentions or no idea this would even happen,"" Oberholtzer said in the video by local television station KHOU. ""Something that we would use to pull trailers and things like that, I mean, to now a truck to be used in terror, I mean that's crazy.""

In an interview with KHOU, Oberholtzer said he's had to take his phones off the hook due to angry and threatening calls from across the United States.

His phone number appears on the bottom of the truck, while the the full company logo and name remains on the side.

It is unclear how the car ended up thousands of miles away in the Aleppo province of Syria. Jabhat Ansar al-Din is an alliance of smaller militant factions established in July 2014 that functions in the hotly contested Aleppo area.

According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, the group is made up of the Green Brigade, Jaish al-Muhajrin, Sham al-Islam and Harakat Fajr al-Sham, which includes both local and foreign fighters.

2016,"Since the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State, Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U.S. In August, Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U.S.

On Tuesday night, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, took those comments even further. Appearing on ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,"" Hunter said, “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that, Hunter replied, “Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true. They weren't.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

UPDATE: Hunter isn't backing off his comments, claiming they came from a ""high-level source"" at DHS.""The Congressman was conveying what he knows—and what he was told,"" Hunter's spokesperson told The Huffington Post. ""And as for DHS’ statement, it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing—it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change. No surprise there."""
2017,"Actor Christian Bale is in talks to play the leading role in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic being produced by Sony, reports Variety. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally in talks to play Jobs, but withdrew from negotiations earlier this month.

Penned by Aaron Sorkin, the Steve Jobs biopic was originally set to be directed by ""The Social Network"" director David Fincher, who was said to be in talks with Sony earlier this year, but the director title went to Danny Boyle instead, who also directed the hit movie ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

When David Fincher was still attached to the project, he reportedly was hoping to cast Christian Bale in the lead role due to his undeniable resemblance to the former CEO. Christian Bale is also known for his ability to adapt to roles, shedding and gaining weight as necessary to accurately portray characters.

Ashton Kutcher famously starred as Steve Jobs in the ""JOBS"" movie that focused on the former Apple CEO's younger years, but the Sony film will be quite different, using material from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography. The film, which has yet to receive a release date, will focus on three separate 30-minute scenes depicting three of Apple's product launches."

2022,"A newspaper report that Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized for ankle surgery has fuelled new theories about the North Korean leader’s long absence from the public eye.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. Since an event with key officials in July, he has been seen walking with a limp. In an unusual acknowledgment last Friday, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort.”

Details from the Hermit Kingdom on Kim’s state of health are scarce and hard to verify, but the new details reported by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper paint a broader picture of what may have happened to him. Here is what is suspected so far.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. He is shown below in photos released by the Korean Central News Agency on Oct. 9, 2010, at left, and July 28, 2014, at right:

Kim is believed to be between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-9, possibly weighing 280 pounds. Chosun Ilbo cited a recent visitor to North Korea (whom it did not identify) as saying that Kim’s weight gain, combined with an intense tour schedule of factories and military bases, as factors in his ankle injury.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the source cited by Chosun Ilbo said. The source said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society. “It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.

North Korea observers speculate Kim’s weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. “Based on his gait, it appears he has gout – something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,” said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” said Hepburn of the U.K. Gout Society. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flareups, which cause more pain.”

Chosun Ilbo’s report also said that Kim was believed to be wearing shoes with Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men’s footwear, to make him taller and give him a more authoritative appearance. Kim is shown below wearing such shoes in a 2012 appearance with his wife, Ri Sol-ju:"
2024,"The artist posted a poignant image in the wake of the shooting that killed 12 at the offices of the French satirical magazine in Paris yesterday

Thousands of Banksy fans have shared this strong pictorial response to the terror attack at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Masked gunmen stormed the offices in Paris, claiming the lives of 12 and leaving five more seriously injured, yesterday.

Among the dead were four of France’s most celebrated political cartoonists, Jean Cabu, Stephane “Charb” Charbonnier, Bernard “Tignous” Verlhac and Bernard Maris.

The following image was posted via this Instagram yesterday, which has since been shared by over 100,000 people:

However, a spokesperson for Banksy told The Independent: ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy.""

The account is actually one of many fakes (Twitter handles @Banksyofficial and @therealbanksy are also fake) set up in the street artist's name.

The drawing appears instead to be the work of illustrator Lucille Clerc:

Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencilforfreedom pic.twitter.com/3n5fOEmrwJ

His reaction follows that of Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who released this statement.

“Very little seems funny today,” he concluded.

Gerard Biard, Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: “I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.”

Barack Obama, David Cameron and Angela Merkel have all condemned the “barbaric” killings and vowed to stand up for freedom of expression.

Seven of the gunmen suspected of being involved in the attack have since been arrested. An 18-year-old accomplice also handed themself in to a police station.

2025,"With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

Decker added, “In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.”"
2028,"LONDON, Jan 9 – Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba’s former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the timing is suspiciously close to the death of another high-profile person who shares his name.

While reports of the death of Cuba’s 88-year-old former leader could be true, there has been no official confirmation and his death has been mistakenly claimed on social media many times in the past.

Also casting doubt on today’s rumours is the possibility it has been confused with the recent death of the son of Nairobi’s opposition leader, named Fidel Castro Odinga, 41, who died only days ago.

However, speculation is rife that the former leader of Cuba has died after Venezuelan media reports the Cuban Government has called for a press conference with the international media today. Venezuela and Cuba have fostered a close relationship for decades.

The report in the Diario de Cuba, didn’t specify a time or subject for the press conference, saying that the Cuban government’s press office wouldn’t give out the information.


It has also been claimed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has rushed to Havana, adding some substance to the rumours that Castro’s death could be announced.

Castro, who passed on Cuba’s leadership to his brother Raul in 2008, was announced Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

He has lived in increasing seclusion from the outside world ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

Today his former Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Perez Silva told various outlets: ‘Fidel is waiting for the right moment, because he is a great prophet who knows the right moment to say what needs to be said.’

2031,"Rats still roam at Vogue!
We’re told by several insiders that staffers at the fashion bible are still seeing rodents at Condé Nast’s new 1 WTC digs, which are still under construction.
A source told us editors spotted at least one critter this week under a desk, and immediately notified Anna Wintour.
“They were petrified, and told Anna, ‘We found rats under our desk,’” a source claims. “One said, ‘There’s a rat on top of my desk.’”
But Wintour replied, “I don’t want to hear about it,” according to our source. A different source also told us there’s “still a rat problem” at the office.
But a Vogue insider insisted there’s no rat issue and Wintour did not dismiss employees’ concerns. “That conversation never happened,” the source sniffed.
Vogue was one of the first glossy titles to move into Condé’s new downtown headquarters, but the rodents seemed to have beaten Wintour and her team to the tower’s 25th and 26th floors.
An insider quoted in People magazine in November said, “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.” Reports say the magazines have issued an edict not to eat at desks to help starve out any Rodentia.

2032,"Kim Jong Un, North Korea's young dictator, sits at the top of a nation that for decades has enshrined the ruling Kim dynasty as demigods. The personality cult that surrounds the hermit kingdom's leadership is one of the strange realities of this pariah state, spawning eerie totalitarian spectacles and the most vigorous displays of clapping the world has ever seen.

It also leads to whole ranks of the population having to surrender their names.

According to a new report on a South Korean TV station, North Korean authorities issued a directive in 2011 — when Kim Jong Un came to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il — to reject birth certificates of newborns named Kim Jong Un and to revise the official documentation and identity cards of those who still had that name.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong Un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” read the document, which was revealed by the KBS TV station on Tuesday.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it said.

The document had been obtained by a North Korean defector who reached South Korea in 2008. As is often the case with these sorts of revelations, its authenticity cannot be independently confirmed.

But the order, if true, should not come as a surprise. Both Kim's father and grandfather Kim Il Sung instituted the same vanity project, insisting on being the first and last holders of their names. The practice has echoes in the deep history of East Asian kingdoms but, like much else in North Korea, really ought not have a place in the 21st century."
2033,"Adding to Apple's iOS 8 launch troubles, a report on Monday claims the operating system's ""Reset All Settings"" feature for hardware wiping user preferences also deletes data stored in iCloud Drive.

As discovered by MacRumors, the issue presents itself when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device's Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.

As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple's public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious.

According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described.

In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.

iCloud Drive is Apple's solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.

Apple will activate iCloud Drive alongside the release of OS X Yosemite later this fall, bringing the company's The feature has already rolled out to beta testers, as well as the iCloud.com beta website, which now supports access and editing of stored documents."

2037,"The Canadian woman who was reportedly kidnapped by ISIS has said she is fine, and that rumors of her capture spread on jihadist websites are untrue.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, joined the ranks of the Kurdish peshmerga fighting force this year, which has elite all-female units.

ISIS sources reported Sunday that Rosenberg was captured in the contested town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, and were gleefully debating whether to execute her or try to negotiate a prisoner swap.

But now Rosenberg, who leaves sporadic updates about her campaign against extremism on Facebook, has posted to clarify that she is in fact alive and well.

'Captured': Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian with dual Israeli citizenship, was reportedly captured - but took to social media to dispell the rumor

She wrote: 'Guys, I'm totally safe and secure. I don't have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security.

'I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bu*****t news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured.'

Sources in the Kurdish militia also confirmed that she is unharmed and was not captured.

Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane, said he had been told by peshmerga members she is fine, and dismissed the reports of propaganda..

Even when the initial reports came out, some sources were sceptical and said Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobane in the first place.

Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border.

She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault.

Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role.

After the reports over the weekend of her capture, Canadian and Israeli government sources said they were investigating the possibility.

IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.

At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.

2039,"While laptop sales continue to drop, Apple's MacBook Air has managed to remain popular and perform well. This year, Apple is set to launch a 12-inch MacBook Air, which could just be Apple's biggest product in 2015.

After being rumored for quite some time, the new laptop from Apple has just been confirmed by the latest report from Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac. Apple has made a number of changes in the MacBook Air, removing and redesigning what users know and love about the machine.

""Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots,"" said Gurman.

The new 12-inch MacBook Air is said to be smaller than its 13-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the 11-inch version. It is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter, which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display. The bezels around the display have also been reduced, giving the front part of the machine a brand new look.

Much of the larger proportion of the machine's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard. Apple has noticeably deviated from the standard keyboard of the MacBook Air by cramming the keys in order to decrease the spaces in between.

Other key changes include the transferring of the power button from the upper left-hand corner to the left side of the escape key and the removal of the travel on the track pad as a way to keep the laptop's slim build.

The new MacBook Air is also a minimalist when it comes to ports as it will only be sporting two, namely the headphone jack and a USB Type-C port. This means that fans of the machine will have to do away with the Thunderbolt connection and the MagSafe charger.

However, the specs of the new USB indicate that the Type-C can support driving displays and device charging.

""The new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers,"" added Gurman.

Apple is yet to make an official announcement on the new MacBook Air. The laptop is speculated to ship in mid-2015 and is expected to use one of the new dual-core Broadwell chips from Intel."
2042,"There's a story currently making the rounds about an Australian man who, upon returning from a trip to Bali, discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest. Freaky? Yes, but it's also not plausible.

Rest easy, arachnophobes. You do not have to worry about Charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh. The supposed story goes like this: Dylan Thomas (a 21-year-old man, not the dead poet) was on vacation in Bali and woke up one morning to discover a red ""trail"" of irritation running from his navel to his chest, a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day.

Thomas says that, after initially being sent home with antihistamines, he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin. Supposedly, they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar. According to Thomas, his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body. Thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days.

It's the kind of story that has a lot of people saying, ""NOPE,"" and a lot of arachnologists saying simply, ""No, that didn't happen."" Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh, but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did.

""I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,"" Christopher Buddle, associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, told us in an email. ""Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.""

Dr. Charles E. Griswold, Schlinger Curator of Arachnology (Emeritus) at the California Academy of Sciences, said he couldn't comment on this particular incident, but was similarly skeptical. ""[I]n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that,"" he wrote.

Could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from Thomas' body? Maybe, but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen. Buddle told us, ""Other arthropods (e.g., ticks/mites/perhaps some insects) could 'possibly' be 'associated' with something like this… perhaps... But certainly not a spider.""

Marie Herberstein, Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in New South Wales, doesn't fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider, though she writes, ""I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders)."" But she also suspects it may be a different animal. She told us, ""My initial reaction is that this is a mite (also 8-legged) rather than a spider, and mites are renown[ed] for this type of behaviour, such as in scabies. Let's see what the identification brings.""

2043,"A woman dumped by her boyfriend spent an entire week sitting in a KFC eating chicken wings.

Depressed Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, decided she needed some finger licking good comfort food to get over her ex and turned to what she enjoyed most - Kentucky Fried Chicken.

She said: ""I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

""I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

""I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.""

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to get concerned.

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: ""We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. At first no one really noticed her.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

He said the woman wasn’t doing anyone any harm so they let her stay.

He added: ""She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.""

Story continues below the slideshow:

After a week Shen decided she’d had enough when local media turned up and decided to write about her.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: ""I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.""

2045,"Amazon has warehouses — hundreds of them, miles of them. It has lockers and pop-up shipping containers. But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors."

Here’s the VITAL NEWS REPORT…

And that’s the story of Banksy’s arrest, in full."
2052,"It’s been a tough month for factchecking. After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled, readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news. And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true.”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market. Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number, “Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures.’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own, with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline: “High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.”

And now it turns out, the real number is … zero.

In an exclusive interview with Mr. Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov, the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean. Swept up in a tide of media adulation, they made the whole thing up.

Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm, 5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell&Mermelsein, Mr. Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC.

Here’s how it happened.

Observer: What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter?

Mohammed Islam: “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me. Then she [Jessica Pressler] called me.”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures.” That’s not true, is it?

No, it is not true.

The Post trumpeted the boys' investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)

Is there ANY figure? Have you invested and made returns at all?

No.

So it’s total fiction?

Yes.

Are you interested in investing? How did you get this reputation?

I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades.”

If you had been playing with real money, would you have done really well?

The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S&P.

Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the $72 million figure?

I honestly don’t know. The number’s a rumor.

She said ‘have you made $72 million’?

[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades.

At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law & Order style objections. A conference outside the room ensued. Back into the room came Mr. Islam.

All I can say is for the simulated trades, I was very successful. The returns were incredible and outperformed the S&P.

Damir, tell me where you fit into this.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Well, I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey, let me get on board. I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica.

But you guys are pals outside of this?

We go to social gatherings and friends’ places.

Are you into stockpicking as well?

I haven’t been into it but I’m interested.

Mohammed, you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school. Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance?

Mohammed Islam: In my immediate family, just me.

So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got $72 million?

Mohammed Islam: Honestly, my dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.

You haven’t? Where did you sleep last night?

Mohammed Islam: At a friend’s house. But we didn’t sleep.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We stayed awake all night. We’ve been checking out news all over the world.

Are your friends blowing up your phones?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn. All the friends shared it.

Mohammed Islam: It was hyped up beyond belief.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We were at CNBC. That’s why we’re dressed up. But we were there and literally in the building stressing out. We had 20 minutes. Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk?

[The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance.]

Where do you go from here?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Socially, people will be mad about it. But we’re sorry. Especially ot our parents. Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father.

Mohammed Islam: At school, first things first. I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused. The people I’m most sorry for is my parents. I did something where I can no longer gain their trust. I have one sister, two years younger, and we don’t really talk.

 

So that’s that. There was no $72 million, no “eight figures,” not even one figure. The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible. New York has now altered its headline to back away from the $72 million figure but the story itself remains. Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.

It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York, which placed Mr. Islam’s alleged acumen at No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue. Ms. Pressler quoted him saying, “It’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …” Yep, nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers.”

No one asked for my opinion, but I’m going to provide it anyway, having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day. They got carried away. They’re not children. But they’re not quite adults, either, and at least Mr. Islam was literally quaking as we spoke. So yeah, they probably should have known better. But New York and the New York Post probably should have, as well. This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment.

2053,"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said.

At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking.

Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule.

After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him, in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district.

Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera. Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills.

He skipped important anniversary

Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea.

Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation.

Since his reappearance, North Korea has released several photos of Kim, but has yet to release video.

According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She said both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress.

After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have swollen due to painkillers. She also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea.

2054,"After a disastrous iOS 8.0.1 rollout and a ton of publicity surrounding Bendgate, saying that Apple had a bad week is an understatement.

Unfortunately for Apple, things aren't looking much better this week, as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive.

According to the report, the option to ""Reset All Settings,"" found under Settings — General — Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive — permanently.

The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that ""no data or media will be deleted."" However, after some users on MacRumors' forum complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone.

Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents — including Preview and TextEdit files — were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected.

In some scenarios it's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn't publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the ""Reset All Settings"" option.

2058,"INNOVATIVE might not be the first word that comes to mind when describing US telephone and cable company Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due?

Let’s face it, after a harrowing 18-minute customer service call went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for — it had reached peak horrible. Yet, if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer’s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.

The full story in all its sadistic glory is at Consumerist, but here’s the SparkNotes version. A customer named “Conal” started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren’t applied. Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he’d never ordered.

This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast’s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal’s employer — a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.

It’s hard to know who’s telling the truth here. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That’s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company’s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring “for quality assurance purposes.” If you want it done right, record the call yourself.

2060,"The two biggest news stories of 2014 collided Wednesday when Iraqi media outlets reported that members of the Islamic State group -- also known as ISIS -- had contracted the deadly virus Ebola. But later updates from the World Health Organization and Iraq's Ministry of Health indicate the stories may be just rumors.

""We have no official notification ... that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, director of communications for WHO, told Mashable, though WHO has contacted Iraqi officials to offer help.

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa. Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""

The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said ""terrorists"" brought Ebola to Mosul. ""Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,"" it read. ""Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.""

Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June. Iraq's second-largest city is also ISIS' largest stronghold. The group began spreading across the Middle East last summer, taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria through brutal tactics."

2062,"Holy crap, Batman -- look what happened to a a once-distinguished news organization.

The CBS Detroit broadcast group's website posts a 10-paragraph article, if that's the right word, about something that may or may not have happened:

A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit and is presumed stolen.  

Sounds serious and dramatic. And yet no other local media outlet has a word about it. 

Further reading suggests why.

""Presumed stolen"" refers to a presumption by the anonymous writer of a four-paragraph post at Bleeding Cool, an Illinois site for comic book fans. Its brief item begins:

The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen. 

That site adds: ""Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.""
The CBS Detroit writer, Evan Jankens, also makes a nod to verification:

Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn’t heard about this, but were looking into it).

Members of the broadcast group are WWJ-TV (Channel 62), WWJ Newsradio 950 and two sports radio stations.

Absent any confirmation, Jankens riffs speculatively on the notion of a possible Batmobile-jacking:

If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? . . . No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
Hey, we like Friday afternoon playfulness as much as the next keyboard jockey, but stay on the other side of publishing a story from someone else's anonymous source that requires disclaimers such as ""if the rumor is true"" and ""we don't know how credible the source is.""

That wouldn't slide past a high school student publication adviser and it seems like a disservice to readers of CBS Detroit, which didn't share the wispy piece on its Facebook pages and presumably not on its newscasts.

The contrasting tweets below show two approaches to the Bleeding Cool short. The first was sent by CBS Detroit's writer to the film director after publication, while the second was posted instead of a preliminary article."

2067,"President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State (Isis) militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq, showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict.

“No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day,” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton, Massachusetts, where he is vacationing.

Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley, an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis, Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century,” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread.”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign, now in its thirteenth day. US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social-media-borne Foley video, although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday.

An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human-rights abuses, from rape to enslavement, calling them “cowardly acts of violence.” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq, Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people,” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past.

With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011, pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis.

The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis. Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal.

Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale, Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep. They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August: preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq.

Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles, artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam. The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff.

Leaders from the UK, France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying. British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response. A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer. US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners, including Americans, have joined Isis.

In the UK, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south-east of England.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said of the video: “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine. We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video, to make sure that it is genuine, and sadly it appears to be, and then to see if we can identify the individual in question.”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism”. French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non-intervention” was necessary to confront Isis, and proposed an international meeting next month.

With a brutality so severe it prompted al-Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise, Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state. It flies a flag, sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs, and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets. While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics, for which infiltration of another’s populace is central, Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory.

Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state, not a terrorist group, a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige. On Wednesday, Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley, 40, who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012, “sickens all decent people”.

“Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people, to bear witness to their fight, and in so doing to fight for press freedom,” Sandra Mims Rowe, the group’s chair, said in a statement.

In a Facebook message attributed to her, Foley’s mother Diane said: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy.

Obama hailed Foley, who he called Jim, and said he had called Foley’s parents.

Foley’s murder, Obama said, was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.”"
2068,"Islamic State leaders in Syria and Iraq are training their fighters to fly captured fighter jets in the hope of establishing an air force, it has been claimed.

The terror group are understood to have been carrying out test flights the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, according to a British-based organisation monitoring the Syrian Civil War.

Having captured three fighter jets from the Syrian military, ISIS are using Iraqi pilots who were once officers in Saddam Hussein's air force to train Syria-based militants to operate the warplanes.

The news comes as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to mend its strained relations with ISIS, urging all jihadist groups operating in the Middle East to unite under the common cause of fighting against Western 'crusader' armies.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

ISIS' alleged test flights over the Aleppo countryside are understood to be the first time the terror group - which seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year - has taken to the air.

'They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

'People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,' he said, citing witnesses near al-Jarrah military airport.

The airport, which was seized from the Syrian regime earlier this year, is approximately 45 miles from the Turkish border.

It is not clear if the jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to be Soviet-built MiG 21 or MiG 23 models.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

ISIS' alleged test flights come despite American and Arab warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in Syria.

The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the first time it had been able to pilot warplanes.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

News of the test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's group.

In a statement released today, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the notorious terror collective's Yemen-based franchise - urged jihadists throughout the Middle East to put their differences aside, according to Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank Quilliam

The document is understood to have called for Al Qaeda - who are represented in Syria by the Nusra Front and Khorasan terror groups - to stop fighting with ISIS, adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking Western 'crusader' forces and carrying out strikes on American targets.

Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

'We urge all Muslims to back their brethren, with their souls, money and tongues, against the crusaders,' the Al Qaeda statement reads.

It also urges Muslims to support 'whoever can weaken the Americans to weaken them militarily, economically, and media-wise.'

Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city.

Sabah Karhout, the chairman of the Anbar provincial council, says the curfew began at midnight this morning as part of an effort to limit movement in and out of the city.

ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants.

Two Iraqi military officials, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to brief the media, say major operations are underway in Salahuddin province to retake key areas from the Sunni militants around Tikrit and the Beiji oil refinery.

ISIS and allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year.

The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the more than eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Iraq's second city of Mosul and much of the north.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,' Shahid said in the recording.

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi."

2072,"Anna Wintour reportedly has a major rat infestation at her Vogue office in New York City.

According to Radar Online, some of the dirtiest rats have decided to move into Anna’s new office for herself and Vogue staffers at the Freedom Tower.

Insiders claim that rodents invaded the beloved accessories closet, leaving an abundance of rat droppings all over their pricey couture, computers, and desks. Further reports claim that the decision to put Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue magazine may have something to do with the infestation.

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover. There was so much backlash, and now this!”

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, critics were not very happy with Anna Wintour and the Vogue staff making the “disgusting” decision to place the reality starlet and her husband on the cover. The couple was photographed for the April 2014 cover by Anne Leibovitz.

Vogue and Condé Nast relocated from Times Square to One World Trade Center. However, the rat infestation has not made the Vogue relocation as smooth as they would have liked – especially since reports claim that the rats are only located on the Vogue floors of the building.

“There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into… The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in. Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes…and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Even though Anna Wintour usually allows employees to eat and drink inside of the office, reports claim that a strict policy restricting food and drinks has been issued and enforced until the infestation problem is resolved.

Gawker, the media outlet that initially broke the story, reports that Anna Wintour refuses to even enter her office until it is in pristine condition and completely freed of its rat infestation.

Anna Wintour has made headlines recently by expressing how she felt about the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot experience. Huffington Post reports that Wintour even hopes that “another Kim Kardashian comes along this year.”

In her own words, Anna Wintour did not feel that the cover photo was “disgusting” at all. On the contrary, she believes that it was touching and charming."
2075,"It's what national security organizations have feared since day one-the World Health Organization (WHO) announced last week that they are evaluating jihadist militants associated with ISIS, who may have contracted the virus responsible for Ebola. While the WHO has yet to confirm whether or not the fighters are exhibiting symptoms, the current evaluations of a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad are prompting concerns that the fringe extremist group ISIS may in fact be able to obtain a biological weapon unlike anything the world has seen before.

Like Us on Facebook 

Though Mosul has been under ISIS control since late last June, the Iraqi health ministry has issued a press release denying reports from Iraqi news outlets that claim the soldier are definitively infected and seeking treatment in Mosul.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus"" spokesperson for the health ministry Ahmed Rudaini says. ""They are incapable to detect it.""

Over the past several months, the world has watched as threats from extremist group ISIS have come true, from the beheadings of captured prisoners of war to the mass murder of children's schools. And with the possibility of a global pandemic looming over our heads, many are demanding action be taken to isolate the potential vectors as a worst case scenario. Yet, as conflicting reports abound, international health organizations and the WHO are unable to assess the health concern on site, and treat the patients as their own.

WHO director Christy Feig told reporters early this weekend that "" We [the WHO] have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.""

While that may be true, the possibility that the militants may have contracted the virus causes a problematic situation for the WHO, in that ISIS does not believe in modern medicine and an outbreak in an ISIS-controlled area like Mosul could be a breeding ground for the ever-mutating virus. But worst of all, aside from the possibility of possible infection of Iraq, should ISIS isolate the virus for themselves, the entire western world may find soon enough that the Ebola virus could be the worst weapon known to man.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" intelligence analyst for Levantine Group, Benjamin T. Decker says. ""In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul."""
2076,"As a chuckling baby, Jess Smith was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1990s.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student.

At the age of nine months, Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland.

The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time, but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary”.

The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university, when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, now aged 19
She said: “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them.”

Jess, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, then broke the news on Facebook.

She wrote: “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it.

“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.”

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess’s name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked. It was really weird seeing her on television.”

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

2080,"(CNN) -- A member of the Sugarhill Gang, whose pioneering hit ""Rapper's Delight"" brought hip hop to mainstream audiences 35 years ago, died Tuesday of complications from cancer.
""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57.
A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts.
Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""
Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday:
""So sad to hear about our brother's passing. The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""
The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records.

Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times.""
""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song.
""It felt like a new art form,"" Rodgers said later of ""Rapper's Delight.""

2081,"A video that appears to a show a bird pooping on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suit during a speech last week is fake.

The video–uploaded to YouTube–is going viral. A few media outlets appear to have been tricked by it. The video is titled: “Bird pooped on Putin at opening of WWI monument.”

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video, apparently believing it.

The Post issued a correction, saying that “a bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday. The video appears to have been a hoax.”

TIME wrote: “A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.”

It later updated the post, saying that “The Independent reveals this video to have been falsely doctored to show a bird defecating on Putin.”

The Associated Press update:

Obama, Putin discuss Ukraine, missile treaty

WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia, President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow-backed pro-Russian separatists. Putin countered by calling U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive.

Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U.S. and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet.”

In an Obama-initiated phone call Friday, the U.S. president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty, the White House said. In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week, the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U.S. and Russian missiles of intermediate range, meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3,400 miles.

Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability, according to a Kremlin report on the call.

It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U.S. and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty.

“I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position,” Obama told reporters later.

The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk, Belarus, among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities. That group includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe."
2084,"The Force may be with us a little sooner than expected as the latest Star Wars: The Force Awakens buzz seems to indicate that the much-awaited sci-fi's release date may be advanced, presumably amid mounting clamor by impatient fans. While different sources suggest conflicting release dates, they all indicate a much earlier premier than the originally announced December 18.

Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a ""Sith Lord"" last week, the same report stated.
There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!
With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute ""official trailer"" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!
The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.
If Abrams and Disney make good on a summer release, this would put the latest Star Wars flick head to head against other much-anticipated films such as Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, Ant Man and Jurassic World, the report added."

After being dumped by her boyfriend, Tan Shen says she was walking the city feeling depressed when she decided to stop into a KFC outlet in a train station in Chengdu China, reports Metro UK.

After ordering some chicken wings, Shen realized going back to her apartment would be too difficult.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think,” Shen said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

""At first no one really noticed her. But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realized we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left,” Jiang Li Lung, a KFC employee said.

Shen ordered more wings and fries and continued to stay in her booth. After a week, local media reportedly started flocking to the restaurant so Shen decided it was time to leave.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving,” Shen said.

But her best line ever?

2091,"The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda, now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa, is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th: the day known as Black Friday.

Bhakkar Fatwa is a small, relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world. The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil.

Jeh Johnson, Director of the Department of Homeland Security, has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America. Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country: always quietly and out of sight, and previously without any violent operations. Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change.

Jack Phillips, agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings. “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”, said Phillips. “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day. The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions. They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve.”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”, stated Phillips. “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks. All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned. The names of those detained will not be immediately released. They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point. Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat.”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”, Phillips advised. ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be. We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations, but this terrorist group is savvy. They utilize a small closed cell structure, and we may not be able to identify all of them in time. I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk. And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open. Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability. I am sure we will resolve this issue, but I still recommend taking adequate precautions.”"
2092,"Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

2093,A report from Judicial Watch stated that four ISIS members were apprehended at the Mexican border.
2096,"Islamic State militants have released a graphic video allegedly depicting the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria since 2012.

The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama.

Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer. The 39-year-old reporter was working for Agence France-Presse when he disappeared, and his whereabouts were essentially unknown until this recording surfaced.

His November 22nd disappearance was classified as a kidnapping by the FBI, which stated he “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria.”

In the new video, the militants proclaimed the violent act as “a message to America” for its decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, where it has made rapid territorial conquests over the last few months.

After stating that President Obama’s decision to authorize military action against the extremist group “effectively [placed] America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” Foley appears kneeling beside a masked man. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life.
Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya.

In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity.

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The video’s release comes just one day after militants declared they would attack American targets “in any place” if American airstrikes kill any of their members. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq.

So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. The group has regularly threatened Christians and other minorities to either convert to their radical take on Islam or die, and even forced tens of thousands of ethnic Yazidis to flee to Sinjar Mountain with no food or water in order to escape being executed.

The last event triggered renewed military and humanitarian action by the United States earlier this month, and airstrikes have been used to help Kurdish security forces beat back militant fighters from northern Iraq. On Monday, Obama announced Iraqi and Kurdish forces had retaken control of the Mosul Dam – Iraq’s largest, and a key strategic landmark – marking the most significant victory for Iraqi troops since the US became involved again."
2097,"SEVEN girls, aged 13 to 15, have fallen pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls fell pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early engagement in sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynaecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents should, he said, play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

2098,"Madrid | The doctors of the Hospital Carlos III confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first human death caused by eating genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died of anaphylaxis after eating recently developed tomatoes with fish genes, causing a violent and deadly allergic reaction.

This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the Spanish man of 31, who died at the hospital in Madrid in early January. The health of the young man quickly deteriorated after suffering an allergic reaction unexplained, and all drugs used to contain anaphylaxis have been totally ineffective. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch, were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.

Mr. Ramos was working as a secretary in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, and began to feel sick just after lunch. A number of symptoms occurred, including a rash with violent itching, severe swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected a degree add'rénaline but his health continued to deteriorate.

The young man was quickly taken to hospital by colleagues, but the medical staff could not identify the cause of the allergic reaction in the time and no treatments or conventional medications seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was pronounced dead a little over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
Forensic scientists and experts from the hospital Carlos III had to perform a wide battery of tests and analysis before we can accurately determine what caused the death of Mr. Ramos, and this because of an allergic reaction to seafood, because the only things he had swallowed before his death were bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich accompanied by a cocacola light. They were surprised when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested allergens contained not only related to fish, but also some antibiotic resistance genes that had prevented the white blood cells of M. Ramos to save his life.

""At first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food, contact with fish or seafood during the preparation"" , explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina. ""It ' is that when we tested the tomato itself, we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood. We did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. ""

Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
 

Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed linked to the ingestion of genetically modified foods. It contradicts most studies on GMOs that have concluded that genetically modified current market crops were edible and without dangers.

A team of scientists led by the University of Nebraska had anticipated this problem in 1996, when they found that the protein of a walnut in Brazil, introduced to improve the nutritional quality of GM soy was able to cause an allergic reaction in Brazil. However, this problem has been rejected by most scientists as unlikely as it could easily be avoided with appropriate safety tests. Soybean genes injections in Brazil nuts were effectively abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused the death of Mr. Ramos was not enough to be tested and risk of death had not been identified before marketing.

The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, which placed the order of Portuguese origin tomatoes that have infected the young man, demanded that they be repatriated and removed from shops and markets for reasons security. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will be seized across the country by ministry inspectors and officials of public safety.

The ministry also made ​​a public announcement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which he offers his condolences to his family and added that ""immediately request further research on the subject, to determine if other food products GM on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

2104,"KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) -
A man rushed to a Kansas City-area hospital Saturday is not being treated for Ebola, hospital officials say.

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.

Chris Hernandez, a spokesperson for the city of Kansas City, said they wanted to take an abundance of caution to avoid a Dallas situation and Sunday he's been told that it's considered ""extremely unlikely"" to be Ebola.

Hamele said Sunday that the patient has been responding well to treatment that day and was upgraded to good condition."

The formidable magazine supremo looked in no mood to mess with as she left Conde Nast's offices on the 25th and 26th floor of the skyscraper.

According to the New York Daily News, the swish new office building is infested with vermin and staff are understandably horrified.

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the paper.

2109,"A SCHOOLBOY who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a massive electrical shock claims he now has superpowers like those of Marvel’s Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, from Russia, had been walking home from school when he lent briefly against a lamppost that was electrified from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

“When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened.

“When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body,” he said.

“Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.”

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, decided to put it to the test.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

“Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me.”

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of being a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai’s classmate, Vika Balandina, said: “I could even hang a ladle on my nose.”

Stories about “living magnets” began to appear in the middle of the 19th century.

Some visitors, however, are apparently better-heeled than others.

According to Bloomberg, Vice CEO Shane Smith spent a jaw-dropping $300,000 on a dinner at the Bellagio's Prime Steakhouse during CES in January.

A group of 12 diners joined Smith at the steakhouse, the brainchild of legendary chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

During an earnings call Tuesday, MGM Resorts International revealed that an unnamed guest had dropped $300,000 on a meal at Prime during the week of CES. On Wednesday, an anonymous source confirmed to Bloomberg that the big spender was indeed Smith.

The Vice CEO had apparently had quite the night at the blackjack tables — according to the Bloomberg report, he had won some $100,000 gambling earlier that night.

MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg that the majority of the check was spent on wine, with some bottles costing more than $20,000 each.

Smith did not immediately return a request for comment.

2114,"(DETROIT) In a decision that’s expected to send shockwaves through the African-American community—and yet, give much relief to teachers everywhere—a federal judge ruled today that black women no longer have independent naming rights for their children. Too many black children—and many adults—bear names that border on not even being words, he said.

“I am simply tired of these ridiculous names black women are giving their children,” said U.S. Federal Judge Ryan Cabrera before rendering his decision. “Someone had to put a stop to it.”

The rule applies to all black women, but Cabrera singled out impoverished mothers.

“They are the worst perpetrators,” he said. “They put in apostrophes where none are needed. They think a ‘Q’ is a must. There was a time when Shaniqua and Tawanda were names you dreaded. Now, if you’re a black girl, you hope you get a name as sensible as one of those.”

Few stepped forward to defend black women—and black women themselves seemed relieved.

“It’s so hard to keep coming up with something unique,” said Uneeqqi Jenkins, 22, an African-American mother of seven who survives on public assistance. Her children are named Daryl, Q’Antity, Uhlleejsha, Cray-Ig, Fellisittee, Tay’Sh’awn and Day’Shawndra.

Beginning in one week, at least three white people must agree with the name before a black mother can name her child.

“Hopefully we can see a lot more black children with sensible names like Jake and Connor,” Cabrera said.

His ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a 13-year-old girl whose mother created her name using Incan hieroglyphics.

“She said it would make me stand out,” said the girl, whose name can’t be reproduced by The Peoples News’ technology. “But it’s really just stupid.”

The National Association of Elementary School Teachers celebrated Cabrera’s decision.

“Oh my God, the first day of school you’d be standing there sweating, looking at the list of names wondering ‘How do I pronounce Q’J’Q’Sha.’?” said Joyce Harmon, NAEST spokeswoman. “Is this even English?”

The practice of giving black children outlandish names began in the 1960s, when blacks were getting in touch with their African roots, said historian Corlione Vest. But even he admits it got out of hand.

“I have a niece who’s six. I’m embarrassed to say I can’t even pronounce her name,” said Vest, a professor at Princeton University. “Whenever I want to talk to her, I just wait until she looks at me and then I wave her over.”

Cabrera’s ruling exempted black men because so few of them are actually involved in their children’s lives.

2115,"An alleged attempted rapist in India received a grisly punishment for his alleged attack on a young teenager – an angry mob dragged him into a butcher’s shop where his penis was severed with a meat cleaver.

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

Kumar is still in a critical condition after the attack.

2116,"Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.

The site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan’s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn’t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.

Amazon’s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.

Opening a physical location is “about marketing the Amazon brand,” said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. “Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.”

Amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Operating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company’s already thin profit margins.

Some details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon’s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon’s growing power in retailing.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach’s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.

The Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy’s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.

“Foot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,” said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.

The streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.

Vornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. “As a former department store, it’s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that’s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants” favor, he said.

Ordering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy’s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.

Amazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.

Amazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don’t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.

Amazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.’s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon’s thinking. By year’s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.

Other primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.

New York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.

Mr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers."

The world knows him as ""Jihadi John,"" the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolise.

""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"" said one of Emwazi's close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post.

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

""There was an extremely strong resemblance,"" Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. ""This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John.

James Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley's killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues."" ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

US officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi's family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It's unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain's domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,"" Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.""

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had ""heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!""

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

""This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,"" Qureshi said. In the end, he felt ""actions were taken to criminalise him and he had no way to do something against these actions.""

Close friends of Emwazi's also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It's unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

""He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,"" one of the friends said. ""He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.""

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It's unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility ""the box."" Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ""George."" A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. ""He was the most deliberate,"" a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

""I was wondering if you could send me your number,"" he wrote. ""Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.""

There was no response.

2125,"On December 17, a site called InSerbia.info published a 400-word piece under the sensational headline:

BiH: Seven Primary School Students Pregnant After Five-Day Excursion


“BiH” presumably refers to — according to the article — the ministry run by Serbia’s National Coordinator for Reproductive Health, Nenad Babici. Babici is the only source the article uses for the story.

The original article has now been linked by the New York Post,  the London Daily Mail, the New York Daily News, Australia’s Courier Mail, Newser, Cosmopolitan UK, and several others. None have performed any follow-up to confirm the original reporting. One newspaper though, added details to the story that were never reported.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start with the underlying original story.

Even in Bosnia, such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and ne’er-do-wells jumping in front of a camera, and copious b-roll of the school’s front entrance. None of this is present. The only source referenced at all in the story is Babici and his claim that it happened. But notably, he is not quoted as saying it happened — he is paraphrased. The remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him, but the quote doesn’t refer to the incident. It instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry, which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences, and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school:

National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.

He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.

Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

“In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said.

Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old.

Look at that last paragraph: if a city the size of Sarajevo only recorded 31 instances of teenage births last year, then Sarajevo doesn’t have a teen pregnancy problem, unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric.

Meanwhile, this story claims the girls were visiting Sarajevo from “a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina” called Banja Luka. It is not at all clear as to what population that “31 minors” is drawn from.

Beyond the shortcomings of the article itself, how likely is the story’s claim?

Statistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons; this study referenced in this BBC article puts the figure at about 5 percent, except for the short window prior to ovulation, during which the study estimates the odds at 25 percent. So either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each, or they each had closer to 20 encounters over the five days.

Or all 28 students were active and about to ovulate. Either/or.

Every scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable, from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage. To a link-seeking media searching for a scoop, this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article, or to stay clear. So how did our brethren respond?

At the start of the post, I mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers, magazines and Websites as the New York Post, the London Daily Mail, the New York Daily News, the Australian Courier Mail, Newser, Cosmopolitan UK. And — perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch — the Daily Mail added details to the story that were never reported."
2127,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”"
2129,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the MQ-1 Reaper.

The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.

According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems.

The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) — of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give U.S. policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.

As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses.

The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.

A second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of U.S. drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

A regional security expert also reports that Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil.

2130,"Vice founder Shane Smith, with something that is not caviar.  Via twitter.com

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

@WarrenBuffett your company @NetJets should be shut down such is the terrible level of service and lies instead of customer service."
2132,"The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”"
2133,"There have been lots of “Comcast delivers bad customer service” stories lately — so overwhelming, in fact, that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem amid worries that disgruntled customers could derail the company’s merger with Time Warner — but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.


Consumerist reports that the customer — known in the story only as ""Conal"" — began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending him items he hadn't order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast's controller. Consumerist reports: ""During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.""

Here's where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps — he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Emphasis added.

Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:

""I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office,"" writer Chris Moran says. ""Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.  And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.""

Comcast told Consumerist it ""will review (Conal's) lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”"

Not surprisingly, the Internet went into a tizzy, but later that day, Detroit police said the theft was a rumour.

2137,"The following is one of the most unusual media stories of the last year.

On Friday, Esquire Magazine posted a blistering piece bashing ESPN written by the publication’s news editor Ben Collins.  It was entitled “ESPN has a problem with women.”

While the column centered on the suspensions of Bill Simmons and Stephen A. Smith, the lead produced some exclusive details about coverage plans for Monday Night Football.  Namely, the network would be having a domestic violence panel featuring 11 different voices.  All men.  Our bold emphasis has been added.

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.
The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

How Collins got that information, whether through his own sources or ESPN itself, was never shared with Esquire readers.  Nevertheless, the “11 men” theme kept coming back throughout his piece as a tentpole of outrage.

The existence of ESPN’s 11 men domestic violence panel, and the anger towards it, spread slowly throughout the weekend.  Deadspin has a nice recap of how far the story reached as it was noticed on Twitter and reblogged across the internet, with one feminist organization even putting the network on blast based on the Esquire article in a press release.

Of course, ESPN is not having an 11 man domestic violence panel tonight.  The network has explicitly and publicly called the Esquire story false as documented below.

But just examining this story from the outset, there was plenty to be skeptical about in Esquire’s story.

First of all, ESPN has covered domestic violence and the NFL at length while involving women in the discussion.  Jane McManus has been a consistent presence on ESPN airwaves and ESPN has a deep bench of female commentators that have talked about the issue on the air.  You can criticize sports networks for not involving women in more prominent ways, but ESPN at least appears to be trying to make an effort here.  McManus defended the network on Twitter:



Second, in light of those tweets, there’s no mention of Suzy Kolber – who will be one of the hosts on Monday Night Countdown tonight.  If there’s any panel discussion happening tonight, wouldn’t she be involved?

Third, it’s easy to make fun of ESPN and the gratuitously absurd amount of NFL analysts the network employs.  But who in their right mind would conduct an 11 person panel on a topic like domestic violence?  That’s not something that even Nancy Grace and the cable news networks would be silly enough to do.

If we’re to believe this Esquire story, Chris Berman would be moderating an 11 person panel discussion on domestic violence including everyone from the game announcers to reporters.  It’s nonsensical.  Not even ESPN would be that dense.

Bristol began the counter-offensive today.  The network released their coverage plans for Monday Night Countdown tonight.  And in a move straight out of the ESPN PR Playbook, they also highlighted women’s contributions to their coverage of the NFL domestic violence crisis.

A rare public statement from John Wildhack, one of the highest on the ESPN Executive Food Chain, also disputed the Esquire report/column/rant/guesswork…

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown.  We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting.  ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage.  Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms,  including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more. 

So how did this happen?  It’s simple.  Haphazard and reckless writing at Esquire gradually began to be taken as fact.

There never were plans for an 11 men panel to discuss domestic violence on Monday Night Countdown.  Collins merely listed the talent that would be working the show and assumed the topic would come up at some point during the evening in an unbelievable failure in communication through the written word.

Collins explained his position in greater detail on his Twitter page:


That’s a pretty far cry from what Collins actually wrote in his article which made it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football team. “Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN.”  There’s no ambiguity in that statement.

100 out of 100 people would read that sentence and think ESPN would be televising a large all-male panel discussion specifically focused on domestic violence tonight.  How does someone who is a news editor at a major publication blur the lines of truth and fiction so badly?




Had Collins stuck with that last tweet he would have had the basis for a decent column and a valid criticism worth raising.  But because of the overall sloppiness of the Esquire piece, that point was missed entirely.

Last week a number of reports emerged suggesting members of the terrorist organisation had contracted the disease.

The Daily Mail reported that three media outlets had said a number of militants had shown signs of the deadly virus in the city of Mosul.

Speaking to Mashable, a WHO spokesperson said they were investigating the reports. ""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications, told the website.

The organisation has now confirmed there are no suspected cases of Ebola in Iraq as of 5 January.

""On 31 December, 2014, Al-Sabah newspaper, Shafaq news agency and Rudaw online newspaper reported a rumour of EVD cases in Mosul, Ninewa governorate,"" WHO said in a statement. ""The news was also relayed through other media agencies in and outside of Iraq.

""Following this rumour, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization investigated the allegations through existing surveillance networks, as well as through contacts with health authorities and medical sources in Ibn Sina Hospital in Mosul.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus.""

It said both the Ministry of Health and WHO has scaled up surveillance efforts to ensure early detection of any suspected Ebola cases, and that all precautionary measures are being taken to prevent the disease from entering Iraq.

""The surveillance efforts have been scaled up at all health facilities to ensure that any imported or suspected cases are promptly detected.

""A contingency and response plan is currently under development.""

2139,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria’s Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the government and said more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls all have converted to Islam and been married off.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

“The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,” he said, laughing.

“In this war, there is no going back,” he said in the video received by The Associated Press in the same way as previous messages.

Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the IS group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists’ version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram’s kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria’s government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing.

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau’s announcement further discredits the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015 in Africa’s most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan’s failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People’s Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election."
2141,"Sons of Anarchy won’t get made into a movie. A hoax article saying that creator Kurt Sutter will launch a film with Charlie Hunnam and Brad Pitt has gone viral.

The bogus piece was published on Empire News, a satirical news website.

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

A number of people apparently believed the fake article.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt."
2142,"Gillian Rosenberg, the Canadian-Israeli woman fighting ISIS with Kurdish forces in Syria, has updated her Facebook page to say that, contrary to reports, she has not been captured by militant forces.

“Guys, I’m totally safe and secure,” she wrote Monday. “I don’t have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security. I can’t reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these buklshit [sik] news stories. Ignore the reports that I’ve been captured.”

News of Rosenberg’s apparent capture first emerged online on ISIS-affiliated websites early Sunday morning. The websites did not post any proof or state whether she was in Iraq or Syria, The Jerusalem Post reported, only saying that she had been taken hostage following three suicide attacks on Kurdish forces.

The Canadian and Israeli governments said Sunday that they were looking into reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman had been captured by ISIS in Syria. They have not yet confirmed the news posted on Rosenberg’s page.

Rosenberg is believed to be the first foreign female fighter to join Syrian Kurds in their fight against ISIS.

In an interview with Israel Radio earlier this month, Rosenberg claimed to be in Iraq and said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas and planned to battle militants in Syria. When asked about her decision to fight, she said, “[The Kurds] are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.”

Rosenberg left Canada and moved to Israel in 2006 and served for two years in the Israeli Defense Forces.

In 2009, she was arrested and extradited to the United States for her involvement “in a phony ‘lottery prize’ scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly.” She served three years in jail for fraud.

Rosenberg said she communicated with Kurdish fighters online before deciding to join them. According to her Facebook page, she arrived in Iraq on Nov. 2.

Rosenberg recently wrote about her eagerness to join the Kurdish forces on her Facebook page.

She also posted pictures of herself, seemingly in Iraq and Syria.

On Nov. 20, Rosenberg said that she would not have access to the internet for two weeks and that someone else would be managing her account.

Photos of Rosenberg brandishing a weapon and stepping on an ISIS flag appeared on LiveLeak on Nov. 22.

Death Hoax

In a report published by Unam Noticias, we read that Millan died in a Santa Clarita hospital of a heart attack. The story states that Millan’s death was announced by his wife at a press conference. The article, as of this writing, has received nearly 20,000 shares online.

The report, however, is not true.

cesar millan

Some shocked readers shared the sad news on social media, without first verifying the claims in the report. Although as of this writing, neither Millan nor his representatives have responded to the death hoax, there are several factors which indicate the article is not true.

Consider:

The original report does not cite any sources.
No legitimate media outlets have reported Millan’s death
There is no evidence that Millan’s wife held a press conference
There has been no such announcement on Millan’s official Facebook page.
The story on Unam Noticias is rife with grammatical and spelling errors (example: “Millan was hospitalize yesterday afternoon, the medical reports indicate that he suffered a fulminate heart attack, which paralyze his heart unavailable for the blood…”
Bottom Line

The report claiming that Cesar Millan died of a heart attack appears to be yet another celebrity death hoax. The poorly-written source of this report offered no sources and has received no corroboration from trusted media outlets or representatives of Millan."

2145,"A Texas plumber says he has no idea how his company's work truck ended up in the hands of Islamic extremists in Syria.

The truck, a black Ford F-250 with the logo for Texas City's Mark-1 Plumbing emblazoned on the door, appeared in a tweet posted Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, a jihadist group operating near Aleppo. In the photo, a man fires an anti-aircraft gun mounted to the bed of the truck, presumably where plumbing equipment used to sit.

— Caleb Weiss (@Weissenberg7) December 15, 2014

Jeff Oberholtzer, the son of the owner of Mark-1 Plumbing, told the Texas outlet The Galveston Daily News that the company sold the truck to AutoNation in October 2013, believing the auto retailer would remove the plumbing decals -- a step Oberholtzer normally does himself, but didn't do this time. He says he has no idea how the vehicle ended up in Syria.

Reached for comment by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, an AutoNation spokesman denied any direct involvement with the truck's odd destination. He said the company sent the truck to be sold at auction, and that it traded hands repeatedly before apparently ending up in Syria.

""AutoNation took the truck in a trade-in, we immediately sent it to an auction house, the auction house then took the title and sold it to a local used car dealer,"" he said, distancing AutoNation from the scenario. ""AutoNation was nothing but the pass-through for this vehicle.”

Oberholtzer told media that Mark-1 has received more than a thousand calls and faxes, some of them threatening, since the Ansar al-Deen Front's tweet circulated Monday.

""We have nothing to do with terror at all,"" Oberholtzer told Texas news source KHOU. ""To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror, it's crazy. Never in my lifetime would think something like that."""

Experts have said this indicated a 'moment of contemplation' for Wilson

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Nightly scenes of unrest have erupted in Ferguson since Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, more than two weeks ago

Officer Darren Wilson (right, collecting a commendation) has claimed that a confrontation sparked by a scuffle with Michael Brown led to the Ferguson teens fatal shooting on August 9 (left, Wilson paces around the body of Brown in the aftermath of the shooting) while witnesses claim the officer continued to shoot at an unarmed man with his hands up who had surrendered

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last Thursday night

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case."

One of its sources for the rumor is a potential advertiser, which said Amazon would unveil the service in order to increase its video share against arch-rival Netflix -- and ultimately tempt users into Prime memberships.

Amazon (sort of) offers limited ad-supported streaming now, by letting non-Prime users watch a limited selection of Prime shows with commercial breaks. If the Post's report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime.

North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un has been missing from public view because he’s recuperating from surgery to repair two broken ankles, a new report says.

The North Korean leader, who has gained weight since assuming leadership of the repressive, eccentric country, had been seen limping in official state videos before disappearing from view in early September.

Kim ended up in the hospital because he put off getting treatment for his injuries, The Chosun Ilbo reported.

The reclusive Kim was operated on at the Bonghwa Clinic, a prestigious medical center for elite party members, the report said.

Speculation has arisen that Kim’s rapid weight gain since assuming leadership after his father,Kim Jong Il, died in 2011, has caused the young ruler to develop gout.

He is also rumored to be a heavy drinker.

His broken ankles were possibly the result of walking in high-heeled boots made in Cuba, during extensive tours of military installations and factories, the report said.

2154,"Experts do not know whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or shot into the ground

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Monday 08 September 2014

Experts from across the world are attempting to understand whether a mysterious bang heard in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday night was caused by a meteorite which broke off from a passing asteroid.

Baffled residents of the Central American city told reporters that they heard a loud boom at around 11pm, but did not see anything shoot across the sky. Meanwhile, scientists are uncertain whether the now missing rock disintegrated or shot deep into the ground.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told reporters.

Jose Millan, from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), said residents of the capital had made a lucky escape as no one was injured.

""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population,"" he said.

A committee formed to investigate the incident have confirmed that the noise was caused by a “relatively small” meteorite that fell from an asteroid passing close to Earth, said Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo.

She added that international experts have been called upon to help local scientists understand the situation and its possible links to the ""Pitbull"" asteroid.

Meanwhile, Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the institute of territorial studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light.""

""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something,"" he said.

A Nicaraguan soldier checking the crater  The meteorite left a crater with a radius 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet near Managua's international airport and an air force base, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan institute of territorial studies who took part in the investigation.

It is yet unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or became buried, he added.

Humberto Garcia, of the astronomy centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to Pitbull.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Two Nicaraguan soldiers guard the crater  Meanwhile, British scientist Dr Dan Brown said he agreed that the crater may be linked to the Pitbull, or 2014 RC, asteroid, but said this was not the only solution.

The astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there,"" he suggested.

Echoing the confusion of Nicaraguan residents and experts, he continued: ""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom - but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that.

""Further analysis will hopefully help to establish this and possibly give a better indication of the object's trajectory. It is still to be seen if any material of the meteorite can be recovered.

""Both pieces of evidence would make it possible to link it to 2014 RC and help us understand more about asteroids,"" he said.

One of the five Taliban fighters traded last year for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is trying to make contact with the Taliban once again, Fox News has learned.

A U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that the former Guantanamo prisoner has been intercepted making telephone calls to the Taliban.

The development comes amid rising concerns over former Guantanamo detainees returning to the battlefield, and over the nature of the Bergdahl-Taliban trade itself last year, which was negotiated with the involvement of the Qatari government.

Despite the apparent outreach by one of the traded prisoners, all five of the so-called “Taliban 5” are still accounted for in Qatar, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.

""There are no indications that they are a risk right now,” another defense official said.

In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said, ""first of all, we take all allegations of re-engagement very seriously. There are different ways of considering re-engagement. It doesn’t necessarily mean return to the battlefield, we take it all seriously.

""We have a good security partnership with the government of Qatar, they have provided assurances and I can tell you, we are comfortable at the Defense Department that we can mitigate any threat that could be posed by anyone of the individuals in terms of terrorist activity.""

CNN first reported that one of the former detainees has tried to return to militant activity. According to CNN, this has touched off a debate in the Obama administration about whether this individual, who was not identified, and even the other four pose a new threat.

The development is already reverberating on Capitol Hill.

""If President Obama continues to release these dangerous terrorists, there will be a steep price to pay – very likely in lost American lives,"" said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.

“I am extremely disturbed by a report that one of the Taliban 5 is suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activities,” Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who wants to suspend the transfer of high-risk detainees out of Guantanamo Bay, said in a statement Thursday. “This report highlights the danger of the administration’s irresponsible decision to transfer the Taliban 5, and underscores yet again the serious risks posed by the misguided effort to empty Guantanamo in order to close it.”

Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, while not able to confirm the report, said it was ""almost inevitable"" that a freed Taliban fighter would return to terrorism.

""Has a terrorist released at (President Obama's) direction returned to militant activity? If so, will he take action to detain this individual as he should have continued to do?"" Thornberry told Fox News. ""In cases like this, the president should not hide behind the convenience of classified information to shield himself from what is reportedly a very serious concern.""

Asked for comment, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said he would not address specific cases.

“However,” he said, “we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary.

2161,"Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

Facebook   Hooked: Dino caught the fish in the Po Delta in Italy where the biggest catfish ever caught was 22 stone

The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything it comes across. They have been filmed eating pigeons that get too close.

In December 14-year-old Sam Lee caught a 15st catfish while on holiday in Spain.

The Chester schoolboy was with dad Peter when the 2.5m carnivorous fish snatched the live bait at the end of his line.

It immediately bolted 100m downstream, but Sam hung on - and eventually landed it after a 35 minute battle.

He then posed for a traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia."
2162,"Reports that 11 commercial jetliners are missing from the main airport in Libya's capital of Tripoli are raising fears that militants could use them in terrorist attacks to mark the 13th anniversary of 9/11 next week.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website, cited anonymous sources who said intelligence agencies have warned the jets could be used in attacks in North Africa and elsewhere on Sept. 11.

The date also marks the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""We have nothing to confirm these reports about missing airliners.""

A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, also said there's been no confirmation that aircraft had been stolen.

Images have surfaced online showing militants posing with the jetliners taken when the militants overran Tripoli's airport last month in a fierce battle that left much of the airport and its aircraft damaged.

In the past four months, a renegade general has battled Islamic militants in the eastern city of Benghazi — cradle of the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi — as powerful regional militias have fought for control of the Tripoli airport. Islamist-allied militias have seized virtually all of the capital.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui said there was ""credible intelligence"" that one Libyan militia ""is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the (region) on the 9/11 anniversary,"" The Huffington Post reported, citing Al Jazeera television.

An aviation security expert said the planes, if actually seized by terrorists, would pose more of a threat to countries near Libya than the U.S. homeland.

Any stolen aircraft from Libya would unlikely penetrate post-9/11 U.S. air defense and security measures, but they could pose a threat to targets that are much closer, said Jeffrey Price, author of Practical Aviation Security and professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver.

Airliners are required to file flight plans before entering U.S. airspace, and air-traffic monitors would be looking for aircraft matching the description of any stolen planes, Price said. An airliner could try to fly below radar to avoid detection, but the U.S. military has developed systems to detect and stop low flying threats, he said.

Price said most countries near Libya, including in Europe, do not have the same air-defense capabilities and would be more at risk.

The reports of the missing planes, which first surfaced in mid-August, likely sparked an international search for the planes by intelligence agencies, Price said. ""It's hard to hide a big jet,"" he said.

The latest report surfaced after an Islamist militia seized a U.S. Embassy residence in Tripoli last weekend, posting video online of men playing in a pool at the compound. In late July, U.S. diplomats evacuated the compound and the capital and traveled to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort as fighting between rival militias intensified and thousands fled.

About 150,000 people have fled Libya during the fighting and another 100,000 have been internally displaced, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.

2163,"Elected officials and activists in New York are reacting positively to the city's new policy that loosens how it treats people found in possession of marijuana.

Many had earlier said that young minority males often were the subject of arrests for marijuana possession, and asserted that punishment for what they considered a relatively minor crime could often affect a person's entire future.

""In light of the fact that there have been a disproportionate amount of blacks and browns subjected to low level marijuana arrests, as well as the fact that many cities around the country are legalizing marijuana use, it is timely for the City of New York to revise its policies,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City-based activist, in a statement.

""With excessive gun violence, hard drug trafficking, and other criminal ills that have plagued our community, I feel that the police ought to concentrate on things of importance rather than things that are now being legalized in many places around the country,"" he said.

Starting Nov. 19, anyone found with less than 25 grams of the drug on them will be issued a summons rather than being arrested, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. The only caveat is there must not be a warrant out for the person's arrest and they must not be found near a location that presents extra concern, such as a school, according to the city.

""This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations,"" de Blasio said. ""Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.""

Voices of dissent with the current policy were underscored by Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who said in July that he would not prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases because of the concerns about how such arrests can affect the lives of young, minority men.

NYC MARIJUANA POLICY: Official eases practices for low-level offenses

Five black and Hispanic members of the New York City Council applauded the mayor's move and said that on Oct. 31, they jointly sent a letter to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton calling for an end to such arrests.

""The mayor and commissioner have taken a significant step towards ensuring fewer New Yorkers face the consequences that arrest records bring,"" read a joint statement from the council members: Ritchie Torres, Rafael Espinal, Carlos Menchaca, Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards.

""We commend the mayor and commissioner for this move, and we will continue to monitor its implementation,"" the council members said. ""The relationship between police and communities, particularly communities of color, frayed significantly during the previous administration. Today's announcement will make substantial progress towards rebuilding that relationship. We look forward to working with the Mayor and Commissioner to implement additional measures needed to restore trust between police and communities."""
2164,"He may have been a few hours late, but a Newfoundland man who vowed to police over Facebook that he would turn himself in has kept his promise.
Newfoundland police said over Twitter Monday afternoon that Rodney Constantine had “kept his word” and turned himself over to authorities after saying he would so in a Facebook comment -- to police.
On Saturday, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary used their Facebook and Twitter accounts to appeal to the public in helping finding Constantine, who was wanted on four warrants, including failing to attend court and breaching court orders.
Not shy -- nor apparently trying to elude authorities -- Constantine responded using his own Facebook account. He wrote on the post: “See you Monday morn !!!!!”
The unusual example of the power of social media in policing took another bizarre twist in the comment’s section, where Constantine and police began a correspondence of sorts.
After noting that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, police wrote: “We commend Mr. Constantine for acknowledging these charges and hopefully he will contact us to have the matter dealt with properly in court.”
Constantine took to Facebook again, just to make it clear he was serious about his imminent surrender: “Look just letting everyone know this ain’t a joke or intended !!!! I was just been honest about turning in Monday morn that’s all !!!”
The unusual back-and-forth sparked a slew of comments from Facebook users, including one person who said police should offer free pick-up and drop-off service for wanted persons.
The police also took the opportunity to chastise people making rude remarks.
“We also would ask that people commenting on posts consider a more tactful and less offensive tone as many of your comments are being ‘hidden’ for simply being outright offensive toward other users or the accused.”
The “wanted” post seeking the accused has since been deleted from the RNC’s Facebook page, but police did post news of Constantine’s arrest, saying he will be seen by a provincial court judge Tuesday morning."
2165,"The masked Islamic State militant known as ""Jihadi John"", who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages, has been named.

The BBC understands he is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born British man in his mid-20s from west London, who was known to UK security services.

They chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

Emwazi first appeared in a video last August, when he apparently killed the American journalist James Foley.

He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

'The Beatles'

In each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose.

Speaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown.

Earlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded.

Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were given the nicknames ""John"", ""Paul"" and ""Ringo"" by their captives, and were known collectively as ""the Beatles"".

Analysis: Dominic Casciani, BBC News

We don't know exactly when the British or the American security services worked out that the masked man in the killing videos was Londoner Mohammed Emwazi.

But we do know that he was a ""person of interest"" to MI5 going back to at least 2010 because he features in semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK.

Nobody in official security circles is going to comment on what they know and why they know it.

Emwazi has been previously described as a member of a network involving at least 13 men from London - and at least two of them were subjected to house arrest control orders or T-Pims. One absconded. The chances of Emwazi ever returning to the UK are vanishingly small.

Follow Dominic at @BBCDomC

BBC News special correspondent Lucy Manning says Emwazi is understood to be about 27 years of age.

Friends told the Washington Post that he was raised in a middle class area of West London and studied computer programming at the University of Westminster. He would on occasion pray at a mosque in Greenwich, they said.

Emwazi's friends told the Washington Post that they believed he started to be radicalised after travelling to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation.

He and two friends had planned to go on a safari, but once they landed in Dar es Salaam, they were detained by police and held overnight, they said.

Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK.

The incident is apparently described in a report published the following year by the Independent. It identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

'Live investigation'

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, he was detained by British counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait, his friends said.

It is believed he was known to security services in the UK and the US before leaving for Syria and was linked to a man with connections to al-Shabab, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani.

The Washington Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and later joined Islamic State, which has declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls.

British police declined to comment on the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

2167,"(Reuters) - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, described them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: ""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ""snow bride"" wearing a bra and lipstick. ""The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. ""It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"" one wrote.

""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.""

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

2168,"In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients."

2171,"Over the weekend, Reddit user fryd_ posted a letter that Lego included in boxes of its toy building bricks in the 1970s. Addressed to parents, the note has a message about gender equality and gendered children's products that many toy companies today still don't seem to understand.

The letter reads:

To Parents. The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls. It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship. A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses. The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The Reddit user told Buzzfeed that he found the note while playing with Legos with his niece and nephew at their grandmother's house. ""It struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago,"" he said, adding, ""I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!""

This letter's message is consistent with the gender-neutral Lego ad from 1981 that made the Internet rounds back in February. The creator of the ad, Judy Lotas, told The Huffington Post, ""Boys and girls are different, but not to the exclusion of wanting to create and build. That’s not a gender issue.""

2175,"A former PGA Tour player claims Tiger Woods has been suspended for one month under the Tour’s anti-doping program.

Dan Olsen, who has made 35 career PGA Tour starts and was an exempt player for the 2004 season, made the claim Friday on radio station WVFN to host David DeMarco.

“I’ve heard that he’s on a month(-long) suspension,” Olsen said, claiming the information came from “exempt Tour players.” Olsen said Woods did not test positive for testosterone but for “something else.”

Olsen continued, “I think when it’s all said and done, he’s going to surpass Lance Armstrong in infamy.”

Woods’ agent Mark Steinberg released a statement to Golf News Net, saying, “These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false. They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.”

PGA Tour media official Joel Schuchmann released a statement on behalf of the Tour, saying, “Regarding the allegations made by Dan Olsen concerning Tiger Woods, there is no truth whatsoever to his claims and the PGA Tour categorically denies them.”

The Michigan-based pro added he believes Woods was faking the back tightness that Woods cited in withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open after just 11 holes.

Olsen, whose last PGA Tour start was the 2011 PGA Championship, also made several wild accusations concerning Woods’ golf ball, incorrectly identifying dates during which Woods made changes in the ball he uses. Olsen alluded to comments made by Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo concerning the advantage he felt Woods had in 2000 (not 1998 or 1999 as Olsen claimed) in switching to Nike’s first solid-core golf ball. After switch in May 2000, Woods went on to win the final three majors that year, just before Titleist introduced its Pro V1.

Further, Olsen claimed Rory McIlroy wanted out of his Nike contract if he couldn’t have access to the same ball as Woods.

Switching subjects, Olsen also claimed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem personally visited Dustin Johnson’s home twice in an effort to help the pro with his “personal challenges” before a six-month leave of absence from golf that ended in February. Johnson has disputed a Golf.com report saying he was suspended for that half-year period because of a failed drug test under the Tour’s anti-doping program."
2176,"Longtime ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Tom Brokaw reportedly wants his successor, Brian Williams, thrown out of the big chair after he admitted fabricating key portions of a story he repeatedly told about his reporting experience during the Iraq War in 2003.

The New York Post, citing sources at the network, reported that Brokaw, 74, has been ""making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.""

Brokaw was the anchor of NBC's flagship evening newscast when Williams filed his initial report in March 2003. In it, Williams described how he was traveling in a group of helicopters forced down in the Iraq desert. On the ground, Williams said, he learned the Chinook in front of him ""had almost been blown out of the sky""; he showed a photo of the aircraft with a gash from a rocket-propelled grenade.

Williams succeeded Brokaw as the ""Nightly News"" anchor following the 2004 presidential election, and his story evolved over time.

In a 2008 blog post, Williams said that his helicopter had come under fire from what appeared to be Iraqi farmers with rocket-propelled grenade. He said a helicopter in front of his had been hit.

Then, in a 2013 appearance on David Letterman's ""Late Show"" on CBS, Williams said that two of the four helicopters he was traveling with had been hit by ground fire, ""including the one I was in.""

On Wednesday, Williams recanted that story, claiming he was that he was flying in a Chinook helicopter behind the formation that took fire. However, on Thursday, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, which broke the story, reported that Williams was actually flying with a different helicopter company altogether, in a different direction, and linked to the attacked unit only by radio.

Adding to the intrigue, the Post reported that Brokaw and former NBC News president Steve Capus, who left the network in 2013, knew that Williams' updated version of his tale was not true before the anchor's admission Wednesday evening. The paper also says NBC News executives had counseled Williams to stop telling the story.

Despite Brokaw's campaign, the paper says NBC will take no action against Williams, believing that his on-air apology Wednesday will suffice.

""He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way,"" one source told the paper. ""He has the full support of NBC News.""

2177,"On Monday morning, a report surfaced claiming that Comcast has been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the Internet with greater anonymity than most browsers. Monday’s report was repackaged on a number of other sites, stating that Comcast has ""declared war on the Tor Browser."" The report goes on to suggest that Comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using Tor. The report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate.  

Comcast is not asking customers to stop using Tor, or any other browser for that matter. We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth. 

Here are the facts:

Comcast doesn’t monitor our customer’s browser software, web surfing or online history.

The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.  

We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process, just like other ISPs. More information about these policies can be found in our Transparency Report here.

We do not terminate customers for violating the Copyright Alert System (aka ""six strikes""), which is a non-punitive, educational and voluntary copyright program. Read more here.

Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself.  I’m sure many of them are using it right now."
2178,"Comcast has lately found itself issuing public apologies on a somewhat regular basis as subscribers share tales of horrible customer service.

But the latest accusation leveled against Comcast—that it is threatening to disconnect customers who use the anonymity-providing Tor browser—hasn't been backed by convincing evidence that it's happening. And Comcast dismisses the rumor as “wildly inaccurate.”

It began Saturday with a site called DeepDotWeb claiming that Comcast has “declared war on Tor Browser.”

“Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service,” the article said. “A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an ‘illegal service.’ The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor.”

“Kelly” allegedly told the customer that “Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules.”

“I think the story is nonsense”

There was good reason to be skeptical of this report. A search of the subreddit /r/darknetmarkets for Comcast and Tor turned up nothing. (UPDATE: Here is the reddit post quoted by DeepDotWeb.) Any organized Comcast campaign against users of Tor would likely inspire numerous customer complaints, not just a few, as noted by Cato Institute Research Fellow Julian Sanchez and security researcher Robert Graham, who wrote on Twitter:


""This story is wildly inaccurate,"" Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas told Ars. ""Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise.""

While Comcast publishes an acceptable use policy, the company ""doesn’t monitor users’ browser software or Web surfing and has no program addressing the Tor browser,"" Douglas said.

In some previous cases where customers have documented poor customer service, Comcast has admitted fault and said its customer service agents acted in error. In this case, Comcast says it investigated the story and found no evidence that the encounters ever happened.

""The anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents’ messages and is not accurate,"" Douglas said. ""Per our own internal review, we have found no evidence that these conversations took place, nor do we employ a Security Assurance team member named Kelly. We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process.""

Comcast's Jason Livingood, VP of Internet communications and engineering, also disputed the report in a blog post today. ""Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself. I’m sure many of them are using it right now,"" he wrote.

The DeepDotWeb report has other problems. It falsely stated that ""Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the 'Six Strikes' plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are e-mailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the 'Six Strikes' plan five more times, their Internet service will be terminated.""

In fact, Six Strikes reports are the result of content companies monitoring online activity and notifying Internet service providers of potential violations. Comcast says it uses e-mail and in-browser alerts to ""educate"" customers about copyright violations, but it doesn't cut off service. Nonetheless, the DeepDotWeb report was credulously re-reported by a few other news outlets that didn't seek further confirmation. The stories are being shared by Twitter users, who often add expressions of outrage:


Tor isn't for criminals

Tor Project Executive Director Andrew Lewman told Ars that it doesn't have enough information on the Comcast rumors ""to know whether this is a company-wide practice."" He noted that ""people with uncensored connections to the Internet can use Tor to share their access with human rights defenders and journalists behind national firewalls. We tend to have good relationships with Internet service providers in free societies for this reason.""

Tor itself was unfairly branded ""the Web browser for criminals"" by one news report:

2180,"No suspected cases of Ebola have been found in Iraq, despite reports to the contrary in Iraqi media in the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.

Describing reports of suspect cases of the deadly viral infection in Mosul as ""rumor"", the Geneva-based United Nations health agency said it and the Iraqi health ministry had conducted a full investigation.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""The [Iraqi] Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola virus.""

Reports of suspected Ebola cases appeared on December 31 in Iraq's Al-Sabah newspaper, Rudaw online newspaper and on the Shafaq news agency and were relayed through other media in and outside Iraq, prompting the WHO and Iraqi authorities to investigate."
2181,"ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” will not be featuring a discussion in which an all-male panel discusses domestic violence.

In fact, the telecast of the game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs will feature just a regular pregame show. There was never, the network says, a panel discussion about the topic planned for tonight.

The network was hammered with calls after an Esquire blog post (“ESPN Has a Problem with Women”) indicated that an all-male lineup would debate the topic, which has been a hot once since the second Ray Rice video surfaced three weeks ago. On Monday, in the third game since the explosive video triggered the NFL’s domestic violence crisis, “it’s a normal lineup for ‘Monday Night Football,’” according to Chris LaPlaca, ESPN’s senior vice-president of corporate communications.

That lineup, of course, includes Suzy Kolber, who hosts the two-hour “Monday Night Countdown” show, and Lisa Salters, reporter and sideline reporter. In a statement on the matter, John Wildhack, executive vice-president of programming and production, said:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more."
2184,"Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.

McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.

So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NO

They are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.”

For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window."

2186,"A hoax that went viral on the internet has left fans of one country musician wondering exactly how all the madness began.

Inquisitr reports that the internet was aflame with reactions after fake news that country legend Willie Nelson had died. Although 81-years-old, the legendary crooner has not yet kicked the bucket.

The rumor about Nelson's demise first began on the fake site MSMBC, according to Inquisitr. The initials for the site so closely mirror the actual news organization MSNBC that people glancing at the headline understood it to be true.

The fact the story cited made up police officials also lent it an undeserved air of credibility. The story claimed that Nelson's body was found on the front lawn of a property he owns in Maui, HI.

The nature of the story and Nelson's iconic status combined to allow this false story to go viral on social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and others."
2187,"The most expensive Apple Watch set to go on sale in April will have to cost around $10,000, according to analysis done by the timepiece blog Grail Watch.

That's mostly because the Apple Watch Edition has a frame made from solid 18-karat gold, which is very expensive.

Grail Watch notes that gold sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per ounce these days. By that measure, the Apple Watch Edition's frame would cost around $8,300 for the larger 42mm version, excluding all other costs.

That's assuming the watch's case is made from solid gold, not gold-plated. But the blog notes that Apple's marketing material never uses ""gold-plated"" or ""gold-filled,"" which is conventional terminology for gold-plated materials, and that Apple must abide by laws governing how jewelry makers describe their products.

The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000. Apple has only announced the price of the low-end Apple Watch Sport, which will sell for $349.

But gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the $10,000 mark. Cartier's Tank MC lists for $22,000 and Jager-LeCoultre's Reverso Squadra Hometime lists for over $23,000.

Even if the Apple Watch Edition sells for less than its analog competitors, it will still be Apple's most expensive product.

Grail Watch predicts the larger Apple Watch Edition will go for $9,999, with the smaller version retailing for $7,999."
2188,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."
2191,"(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town near the border with Niger, killing at least 8 and kidnapping others, residents told CNN Saturday.

Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire, which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group.

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009.

The deal, the government said, includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April.

The deal, first reported by Agence France-Presse, came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur.

""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said.

Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency.

""On the war front, we can say there is peace now,"" he said Friday.

What is Boko Haram?

A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.

The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

Where are the missing girls?

2192,"WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a way of raising overseas cash."
2196,"With its huge, gaping mouth, it looks big enough to swallow a person whole.

This giant catfish, which weighed 20 stone (127kg) was caught by twin brothers Dino and Dario Ferrari in the Po River of northern Italy.

Dino Ferrari caught the 127 kg catfish in the Po delta of Italy (Sportex Italia)

Believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever caught, the creature was pulled from the river on Feb 19 with a rod and line after a battle lasting 40 minutes.

The nine foot-long creature, a wels catfish, has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media.

The fish was released after the trophy photos (Sportex Italia)

After catching, weighing and photographing it, the brothers released it back into the river, which flows across northern Italy to the Adriatic.

“It’s a silurus glanis [the Latin name for the species],” Dino Ferrari said. “The American catfish doesn’t grow to such large dimensions – at most it can weigh 50kg.” He estimated the fish to be about 30 years old, based on its size, adding that the species can live for up to 50 years.

“They don’t range over very large distances, they tend to live in the same stretch of river, moving just a few kilometres either way. They eat all types of fish.

""To catch them you need a lot of patience but also physical strength. We fought for 40 minutes to reel it in. We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water.”

The wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia but was introduced to western Europe.

The fish prey on other fish, as well as worms, crustaceans, frogs and water fowl.

“Who knows, maybe we will manage to catch it again in a year’s time, and it will be even more gigantic,” said Mr Ferrari."
2197,"Islamic State brutes fed a distraught woman searching for her kidnapped son some meat and rice – and then told her she had just eaten her son, according to a British man who joined the fight against ISIS.

Yasir Abdulla, 36, of Yorkshire left his wife and four kids to battle the maniacal extremists in his Kurdish homeland, The Sun reported.

“I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe,” he said. “Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.”

He said the thugs told her to rest after her long journey and offered her the food before taking her to her son.

“They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind,” he said.“But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, ‘You’ve just eaten him,’” Abdulla told The Sun.

Abdulla decided to take on the murderous group after they came within six miles of his home in Kurdistan.

He said he bought combat fatigues online and an assault rifle in his Kurdish hometown – then joined other volunteers on the front lines.

“We want to attack IS and drive them out forever but we can’t unless the Peshmerga and the Americans say we can,” he said, referring to the military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Abdulla described the jihadists’ terror tactics, including slaughtering prisoners in bonfires.

“They dig a trench, put dry tree branches and leaves in there, set it alight and then throw prisoners on so they burn alive,” he said. “IS are very good at making people scared. If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.”

“But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us. If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can’t happen.”

Yasir, who returned to the UK last week, remains confident and vows to return to Iraq to help the rebels defeat the fanatics."
2200,"A video released by the Islamic State on Tuesday allegedly shows a stray weapons bundle from the United States that missed its target in Kurdish-controlled areas near Kobani, Syria and instead fell into the hands of IS (ISIS or ISIL) militants.

Sunday evening, the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. military had conducted a weapons drop to supply Syrian Kurds fighting IS militants in Kobani with small arms and supplies.

Pentagon Spokesperson Rear Adm. John Kirby also confirmed Monday that one of the bundles had missed its target, but that it had been destroyed so that “ISIL terrorists couldn’t get to it.”

The video, released by unofficial IS news agency Aamaq, bears the Arabic title: “Arms and ammunition delivered by American planes fell in areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.”

The video shows an IS militant rifling through the weapons and supplies, which include grenades, explosive canisters, and RPG rounds.

2202,"The ""Jihadi John"" killer who has featured in several Islamic State in Iraq and Syria beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle class family who grew up in London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming, the Washington Post newspaper said.

In videos released by ISIS, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons.

The BBC said Emwazi is suspected of appearing in videos that showed the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, who also went by Peter.

The black-clad militant also appeared in videos in January 2015 that showed Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed.

The Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined ISIS.

""His real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming,"" the Post said.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

The paper said he had been born in Kuwait, was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, southeast London.

Police declined to comment on the reports.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter- terrorism investigation,"" said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London.

They said Emwazi and two friends - a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib - never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster."

Nikolai pictured with a load of cutlery and coins sticking to his back. He claims he woke up with the 'superpower' after he suffered an electric shock

Stories about living magnets such as Nikolai (pictured) began to appear in the middle of the 19th century

The schoolboy claims to have powers similar to Magneto, from X-Men. Pictured is Sir Ian McKellan, who played the character Magneto in the movie X-Men: The Last Stand

'When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.'

He said he is a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before, but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.'

Nikolai added that he has now decided he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets', many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7kg of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin."

2208,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video.

A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners.

 A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.

Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda.

Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region.

The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias.

Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli. The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second-story balcony at the facility.

Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July. Photos of the airport in the aftermath showed a number of damaged aircraft. The airport has been closed since mid-July.

The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s. Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.

The aircraft were reportedly taken in late August following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport, located about 20 miles south of the capital, by Libyan Dawn.

Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets.

In response, Tunisia stopped flights from other Libyan airports at Tripoli, Sirte, and Misrata over concerns that jets from those airports could be on suicide missions.

Egypt’s government also halted flights to and from Libya.

Military forces in North Africa, including those from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft.

Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently, and U.S. officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi was quoted as denying Egyptian air strikes into Libya have taken place but suggested that military action is being considered.

Secretary of State John Kerry last week told his Egyptian counterpart that the United States would speed up the delivery of Apache attack helicopters, although it is not clear the Apaches would be used in any Libyan operations.

Egypt’s military-backed government appears to be seeking a more significant role in regional security after the Obama administration helped engineer the ouster of Libyan strongman Moammar Qaddafi in 2011. Since then, the Obama  administration, through its announced policy of “leading from behind,” has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos.

The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli.

“We announce that the majority of the ministries, institutions, and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control,” a government statement said.

Libya’s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government.

Ansar al Sharia, which is based in Benghazi, recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons, including SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria.

Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December.

The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012.

Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.

Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9/11 anniversary.

Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.

“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”

Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.

“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”

Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.

“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.

A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.

The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"
2210,"Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

Hurricane Floyd aftermath
According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil.


 
Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”


Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment"

2213,"On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its first wearable device, the Apple Watch. During the company's presentation, we learned a lot about what you'll be able to do with the company's new smartwatch.

But what we didn't learn, however, is how long its battery would last on a single charge.

That may be because Apple is still working out this detail, as a new report suggests.

Attributing anonymous sources, Re/code's John Paczkowski reports that Apple isn't happy with the watch's battery life just yet. In its current form, the watch's battery life will not break any industry standards, Paczkowski says.

Right now, the Apple Watch's battery life is about one day, but Paczkowski's sources say Apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its 2015 launch.

This aligns with what we've heard from Apple as well, since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night. Apple hasn't offered any further comment on the watch's battery life.

Battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices. That's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and aren't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets, Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys Insight, told Business Insider in a previous interview.

""We're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we don't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices,"" Jones said. ""We're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there.""

2 dead in shooting attack at Canada’s Parliament

OTTAWA, Ontario—A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country’s capital was shot to death Wednesday, and heavy gunfire then erupted inside Parliament. One gunman was killed, and police said they were hunting for as many as two others.

The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor.

Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point-blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, with a scarf over his face. They said the gunman then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Police gave no details on how the gunman died. But on Twitter, Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit said two or three gunmen were believed to be involved in the attacks.

Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Ottawa Hospital said it received two patients, both listed in stable condition, in addition to the soldier.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as “outrageous,” and in a telephone call with the prime minister, offered U.S. help and reassurance of the American people’s solidarity with Canada.

The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

Tony Zobl said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

Zobl said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.

“I’m safe locked in a office awaiting security,” Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill."

2217,"In an aptly described “joint policy initiative,” Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced Monday that most people caught with small amounts of marijuana in the city will get slapped with summonses instead of arrested.

The historic move marked a public about-face for Bratton, who earlier this year vowed NYPD practices wouldn’t change after the Brooklyn district attorney’s decision not to prosecute first-time offenders for low-level pot possession.

Sources said the new policy was ordered by de Blasio, whose campaign promises included ending marijuana arrests that overwhelmingly targeted minorities.

“It began with the mayor, as his initiative,” said an elected official familiar with the issue. “It was something very dear to the mayor that had to happen, no matter what.”

Bratton, the sources noted, did not resist de Blasio’s directive.

The NYPD declined to comment. City Hall credited both men with the idea.

“This is a joint policy initiative, developed and implemented by Commissioner Bratton and the leadership team at the NYPD, and fully supported by the mayor,” a de Blasio spokesman said.

Joined by de Blasio at 1 Police Plaza, Bratton said he and other police officials had been working on the change in policing tactics for “the last number of months.”Under the new policy,people busted for possessing 25 grams or less of pot — a violation under New York law — will no longer be cuffed, hauled off to a police station, fingerprinted and booked.

Bratton held up a plastic sandwich bag stuffed almost full of oregano to illustrate how big a stash was at issue.

“To give you, the public, a sense of what 25 grams of marijuana would look like, that’s about it,” he said.

“It’s not a large amount.”

Chief Thomas Purtell of the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau put the value of that much actual weed at $300.

The new policy covers only marijuana that appears to be for “personal use,” rather than for sale. Anyone caught smoking in public will still be subject to arrest regardless of the amount of pot in view, the commissioner said.

Other exceptions to the no-arrest rule include people with open arrest warrants, those wanted in connection with active investigations or pot carriers who don’t have identification.

Bratton said the policy would be put into writing and a training video would be shown to cops during roll call before it goes into effect on Nov. 19.

But law-enforcement sources said an unwritten version of the policy was enacted “on the command level” about a year and a half ago under then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

“If you saw someone smoking a joint, you would bring them back to the precinct and give them a summons if they didn’t have a record,” a source said.

Kelly declined to comment Monday.

The new policy effectively neutralizes Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson’s refusal to prosecute low-level pot arrests, which he said were clogging the justice system and taking “an unnecessary toll on offenders.”

It also maintains a revenue stream for the city, because the summonses carry fines of up to $100 for first-time offenders and up to $250 for second-timers.

In a statement, Thompson said, “I applaud Mayor de Blasio’s decision.” which he called “similar to the approach that I have taken in Brooklyn.”

But he said he was “concerned about the due-process rights” of Brooklynites who get issued pot summonses, because almost all Brooklyn violations are prosecuted in Manhattan Criminal Court.

De Blasio described the new policy as a win-win. win, especially for young minorities., saying, “We don’t want to saddle people who have made one small mistake with something that will follow them for the rest of their lives.”

“It will certainly be good for New Yorkers of color, and particularly young people of color,” the mayor said.

“When an individual is arrested, even for the smallest possession of marijuana, it hurts their chances to get a good job, it hurts their chances to get housing, it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan — it can literally follow them the rest of their lives and saddle young people with challenges that for many are very, very difficult to overcome,” the mayor said.

“I think you will see fewer unnecessary arrests,” he said.

Monday’s announcement followed a Post report last week that revealed the NYPD had stopped marijuana “buy and bust” operations to focus on harder drugs.

Bratton called the article “false” Monday while admitting he had changed strategy to target only “significant” drug sales.

Law-enforcement sources on Monday confirmed the accuracy of the Post report and said they weren’t surprised by Bratton’s denialattempt to dance around the issue.

“You can’t go on the record that you’re pulling back on marijuana arrests when it’s a law on the books,” one source said.

2218,"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar's First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar's organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.

Taibbi's abrupt disappearance from the company's Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn.

When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi's website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity"" — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the ""simultaneously funny and satirical voice"" associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, founding editor of the Hairpin.

""Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,"" Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. ""It's appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.""

Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi's name at Rolling Stone — and before that, as the founding editor of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile — appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look.

Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi's absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming ""in a month"" — now appears to have been pushed off.

""We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,"" said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. ""I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. ... I mean we’re a private company, so why would we ... no.""

Taibbi's absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused ""digital magazines."" In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government's voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety.

In August, Temple told me Taibbi's site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics.

""We're supporting Matt in creating something unique — and it's Matt's,"" Temple told me. ""He's building a team and there's great esprit in Matt's team.""

Taibbi's clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist's own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring."
2219,"A British man who went to fight with the Kurds against Islamic State has claimed the terror group fed a desperate mother a meal of meat and rice before revealing she had eaten her own son. Yasir Abdulla, 36, from Yorkshire said that the woman had appealed to IS to release her son when they tricked her.

Adbulla told The Sun the woman was offered a seat at IS headquarters, then given a drink along with cooked meat and rice. At first she thought they were being generous, but when she finished the meal they revealed the cooked meat was the flesh of her son, whom they had murdered earlier.

Mr Adbulla said: “I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe. Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul.

“She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him. The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

“They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

“But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, ‘You’ve just eaten him’.”

He added: “All the tribes are united against IS. They burn people alive, they chop off people’s heads, there is no limit to their depravity. They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.”

This is not the first report of horrific barbarism by the Islamic State, a group that have become famous for the gruesome treatment of their prisoners. In some cases they have beheaded them on camera, and in others they have burnt them alive.

The woman who ate her son has not been traced."
2220,"An unverified audio recording that may have captured the shooting of Michael Brown is being investigated by the FBI, according to a report.
News that a recording had surfaced was revealed on CNN, although the network said it had not independently confirmed that the alleged gunshots heard on the tape were from the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9.
In the recording, a man who has not been identified is heard speaking when a series of gunshots can be heard in the background. There is a quick pause and then another round of gunshots are fired. According to CNN, the man lives near where Brown was killed and was talking to a friend online at the time, which is how the ambient sound was recorded. The man didn’t realize what he had recorded initially and only later became aware it could be tied to the Brown case.
According to Lopa Blumenthal, the lawyer representing the man who made the recording, the tape could have “huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”"
2221,"MIAMI — The bulletin now falls squarely in the pantheon of unconfirmed phenomena, along with U.F.O.s, sightings of the Loch Ness monster and the breakup of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie:

Fidel Castro is dead.

Sooner or later, it will be true. But on Friday, for the umpteenth time, Miami was distracted by the rumor that Mr. Castro, 88, who has survived revolution, assassination attempts, countless cigars, substantial stress, a fall after leaving a stage and a life-threatening stomach ailment, had finally succumbed.

“Hope springs eternal,” said James Cason, the former head of the United States Interests Section in Cuba from 2002 to 2005 and now the mayor of Coral Gables, a wealthy enclave in Miami-Dade County. “He must have died 20 times since the time I went to Cuba.”

Cuban-Americans gathered in the usual spot, the Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho, and other Cuban establishments to ponder the possibility that this time, maybe, maybe, it would be true. But even here in a city still fixated by Mr. Castro, rumor fatigue was obvious. Versailles had put its Fidel-is-dead game plan into action — assigning some parking spots to local TV and radio stations, but few showed up

It was no different at La Carreta, a restaurant in Westchester, Fla., a Cuban-American stronghold.

“There is always doubt about this; the joke is on us,” said Manolo Alvarez, 75, a retired painter, laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the Cuban cafecito counter. “But eventually it will happen. No one is immortal. And he will join the devil.”

Castro death alerts come fast and frequently these days. His age, ill health, long absence from public view and society’s shift from old-school rumor mill to hyperspeed Twitter feed make even debunked stories effortlessly spreadable. In fact, determining the provenance of each rumor has become a kind of modern-day parlor game.

In this case, the story probably stemmed from a simple mix-up, the death of a lesser-known namesake in a faraway country: Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, Raila Odinga, died on Sunday and was eulogized on Thursday. A similar mistake occurred in August 1997, when a Cuban revolutionary figure, Rene Orley Sanchez Castro, died in Cuba, spawning a swirl of speculation around the world.

Like most of the past false reports, the one on Friday was bolstered by tantalizing circumstantial droplets. The last time Mr. Castro was seen in public was Jan. 9, 2014, making Friday the first anniversary of his disappearance. And Mr. Castro, never at a loss for words, had failed to comment about December’s announcements by his younger brother, Raúl, and President Obama that the United States and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties.

There was also word on Friday of an abruptly scheduled news conference and chatter — true or not — about how the major roads to a famous revolutionary cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Mr. Castro reportedly will be buried, were being repaired.

The likeliest explanation for Mr. Castro’s absence is that he is, in fact, too mentally and physically frail to be seen or to speak.

“We don’t know what his physical state is because they never let you know,” Mr. Cason said of Cuban officials. “But they want him to be remembered as strong and vigorous. They don’t want him to be seen.”

Tales of Mr. Castro’s demise have surfaced for decades. In 1986, the State Department had to beat back a flurry of reports and questions from Miami about Mr. Castro’s apparent death. The sources of the speculation were varied and dubious: A ham radio operator in Havana, a nurse in Cuba who telephoned a friend in Miami, a report by an astrologer.

More rumors followed, off and on, and then accelerated after Mr. Castro vanished for a stretch in 2006 and, once again, after he relinquished power to his brother Raúl in 2008. Through the years, Mr. Castro has been rumored to have been stricken by heart attacks, brain hemorrhages, strokes and cancer. He has alternately delighted in and derided the many attempts to “kill him off early,” as he joked once in 1997.

“Now that our enemies have prematurely declared me dying or dead, I am happy to send my compatriots and friends around the world this short film material,” Mr. Castro said in 2006, after his absence.

In Miami, his death, when it is finally confirmed, will be historically momentous and, for most, cause for jubilation. The city will dust off its ever-evolving contingency plans. Even some private schools have early dismissal emails to parents at the ready.

But, to a certain extent, Mr. Castro’s death will also be anticlimactic. Years ago, his death was seen as the necessary prelude to a democratic Cuba and a return home for tens of thousands of exiles. With Raúl Castro firmly in place, that is no longer the case.

“If this had happened at the height of his power, or even when he was just fading, it would be different,” said Peter Hakim, a Cuba expert at the Inter-American Dialogue center in Washington. “This was almost a personal battle not to let Fidel win. Now, I think people are beginning to accept that Fidel has won. He will go to his grave with the government intact and the U.S. backing down from its unalterable commitment to unseat the regime he installed.”"
2223,"Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?"

2225,"LONDON — The North Korean embassy in London has denied  reports on Scottish media sites on Monday that it is planning to open an state-backed restaurant in Scotland.

""I think that is fabricated, it’s nonsense,"" a spokesman in the North Korean embassy in London told Mashable.

North Korea Leadership Watch's editor Michael Madden, who is a frequent visitor to the communist state, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" he said, according to the Daily Record. ""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts. Despite voting 'no,' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

In September, Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of pro-North Korea newspaper Chonson Sinbo, told The Telegraph that North Korea has quietly endorsed Scottish independence.

""I believe that every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality,"" Choe said. ""And I believe that a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.""

North Korea has restaurants in parts of Asia as well as one branch in Amsterdam, which are used to funnel foreign currency back into the regime's treasury. The restaurants have existed for years in parts of China, while expansion to other parts of Asia began in the early 2000s.

2227,"Looking back, maybe the human baby face superimposed on a cheery yellow cartoon sun was creepy.
But that didn't stop the sun baby watching over Teletubbyland from being accepted as part of the landscape, and that face has been part of so many childhood TV-watching memories for years.
And now, with the BBC reportedly planning on producing 60 new episodes of Teletubbies, the face is all grown up and coming forward!
Jess Smith, a university student from Edenbridge, Kent, (and not Jessica Smith, from Laguna Beach) has spoken out for the first time about being the one whose 9-month-old face was seen by millions through the years, first on the BBC and then in America on PBS.
According to London's Telegraph, Smith's big reveal came during a getting-to-know-you game during her first week at Canterbury Christ Church University, when the students were asked to tell something about themselves that no one would ever guess.
After spilling the sun baby beans, she the blond, blue-eyed teen revealed herself on Facebook.
""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.
""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it,"" she reportedly wrote. ""I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.
""Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.""
Watch the intro right here and see if you can still see the resemblance!

Meanwhile, Jess' mother, Anji Smith, told the Telegraph that the family never realized what a huge part of TV history their daughter would end up being a part of.
""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was,"" she said. ""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked."""
2228,"If you ever visit the Microsoft campus in the Silicon Valley and hear a mechanical voice shout ""Ex-ter-min-ate!"", don't be too spooked. It just means some geek humor has gone a little crazy.

Microsoft's campus in Silicon Valley will be patrolled by a team of five security guard robots from a company called Knightscope. The robot, dubbed K5, is five feet tall, weighs 300 pounds, and looks disturbingly like the Daleks of ""Doctor Who"" fame.

Fortunately, they are not armed with lasers. They use cameras and sensors to monitor their assigned area and look for suspicious activity. They are armed with high-definition cameras and audio recorders, able to record events and voices, analyze faces, read license plates, and even detect biological and chemical agents.

The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigation, have weather sensors, and communicate via Wi-Fi. Their batteries run for about 24 hours and the K5 will return to a dock/power station to recharge.

Should they spot a problem, they call a human security guard. I'm just waiting for Knightscope to decide to cut out the middle man. Or for bored Microsofties to try and hack the thing to play pranks on people.

That sounds like the plot of a bad SyFy movie, doesn't it?"
2230,"By Benjamin Kang Lim and Tony Munroe BEIJING/SEOUL, Oct 9 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power. North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3. The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises. ""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified. ""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing. Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred. If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said. ""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.  NOT KIM'S FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view. In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium. Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort."" Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumors of a coup were ""rubbish."" ""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago. However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition. Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped. ""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said. (Additional reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"
2234,"A video of an airport worker stripping naked to go through a security scanner in protest at heavy-handed security guards has gone viral.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, who works at the airport in the city of St Petersburg in northwestern Russia, had finished his shift and was going home when he remembered he had left his keys at work.

According to news.com.au, he said: ""I returned back to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner. 

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict, and security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""


When officers arrived they also demanded he remove his belt, so Georgy then stripped off everything before walking through the scanner at St Petersburg Pulkovo airport.

He was then allowed to get dressed and leave, but later realised the video had been leaked and he'd become an online hit.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

According to the Mirror, a spokesman said: ""We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.""

George himself as filed a complaint against police over the leaked video, adding: ""I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh."""
2235,"Mediaite writes about CNN’s morning show questioning the reporting of one of CNN’s evening shows.

Monday night, “CNN Tonight” aired an audiotape purported to capture the shooting of Michael Brown. The tape was brought to CNN by St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal, (at right with anchor Don Lemon) who says a former client gave it to her. Lemon repeatedly said that CNN could not verify the authenticity of the tape.

TVNewser has learned CBS News received the same audio earlier this week from Blumenthal, but chose not to run it because it could not be verified.

This morning on “New Day,” two guests on CNN doubted the veracity of it.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN,” said former LAPD officer David Klinger. CNN analyst Tom Fuentes also doubted its authenticity: “When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax.”

WaPo’s Erik Wemple reported yesterday on how CNN got its hands on the audiotape. When asked about its authenticity, a CNN spokesperson told Wemple, “[W]e interviewed the caller’s attorney off camera and she answered key questions that gave us confidence to put her on the air live with Don. And we did confirm the caller lived close enough to the shooting to have heard the shots.”

Now it appears, there are doubts inside CNN."
2236,"Speculation is mounting that one of the senior Taliban detainees swapped for a US army prisoner of war has returned to militancy, following a leak to CNN.

No US official has yet confirmed the allegation, on or off the record. If true, it stands to plunge the Obama administration back into an acrimonious debate about its prisoner exchange for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl – and its long-frustrated aim of closing Guantánamo Bay.

CNN reported on Thursday that one of five Taliban members formerly held by the US at Guantánamo may have re-engaged in unspecified terrorist activity. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said in a statement he “cannot confirm or deny” the report.

Related: US soldier Bowe Bergdahl freed by Taliban in Afghanistan

A representative for the committee, Jack Langer, said classification restrictions would not permit additional detail on whether the Taliban member actually committed a terrorist or militant act, nor which ex-detainee is believed to be the subject of the speculation.

Langer also would not comment on when the committee learned of the allegation against the former detainee, but said that as part of the committee’s oversight responsibilities, it would scrutinize the issue.

So will the Senate armed services committee. “The committee is looking into the details of this issue,” said Dustin Walker, a spokesman, who could not confirm the allegation. He noted that panel chairman Senator John McCain “has expressed concern in the past about the potential for these prisoners to return to the fight”.

Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Haq Wasiq, all detained at Guantánamo since the early days of the Afghanistan war, were placed under monitoring of the emir of Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl. They were not returned to Afghanistan, and are not believed to be there now.

The exact terms of the trade, which occurred in late May 2014, have not been disclosed, but the so-called Taliban Five were said to have been required to remain in Qatar for one year. The Obama administration has said from the start that assurances provided by the emir gave the US sufficient visibility into future activities and potential threats from the five men.

Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, said after the deal was finalized that “in all likelihood” the five ex-detainees “will not pose a national security risk”.

According to CNN, intercepted communications from the suspected detainee indicate he has reached out to his Taliban comrades to encourage additional attacks in a war in which the Obama administration has drawn down US forces. Approximately 10,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, with residual counter-terrorism and training missions but said to be no longer taking part in major combat.

From the start, the Bergdahl swap drew criticism from congressional Republicans. Several contended that releasing the five senior Taliban from Afghanistan was a price too high for Bergdahl, whom the Taliban captured in 2009 following a murky decision Bergdahl apparently made to leave his unit’s base in eastern Afghanistan. House Republicans in particular blasted the US defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, for failing to notify them, as required by law, 30 days before the intended trade, which the administration indicated would have jeopardized the deal.

Related: US army denies reports it has decided to charge Bowe Bergdahl with desertion

While Bergdahl is now assigned to an army base in Texas, the army is investigating whether he should be charged with desertion. This week it batted back media reports that it had decided he would be.

McCain, himself a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam, has not criticized Bergdahl. But he said when the trade occurred that the senior Taliban were “big, high-level people, possibly responsible for the deaths of thousands”.

Nunes, in his statement, warned that if Obama continued with his intended transfers of detainees from Guantánamo, “there will be a steep price to pay – very likely in American lives”.

On Monday, the former administration envoy for closing Guantánamo underscored Obama’s intention to redouble efforts to shutter the controversial facility before his presidency ends, fulfilling a long-frustrated pledge. Additional transfers are expected in the coming weeks.Cliff Sloan, who left the State Department on 31 December, told the Guardian the administration was prioritizing the transfer of detainees already deemed by six agencies, including the military and intelligence leadership, not to pose significant national security risks."
2237,"It's not exactly legalization, but in New York City it could become the next best thing: tickets for marijuana possession instead of arrests.

According to a report on Sunday from The New York Times, the New York Police Department (NYPD) is planning to announce new guidelines that would allow those found in possession of small amounts of marijuana to walk away with a ticket instead of spending time in handcuffs.

The change in policy could have wide-ranging effects in a city known for arresting thousands citizens each year for marijuana possession.

If true, the change in policy could also have a significant impact on the city's black and Hispanic community, which some studies say are disproportionately affected by the police department's current marijuana arrest policy.

The upcoming shift in enforcement, which the report says is something of a throwback to the city's policy in the late '70s, comes just days after Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. voted to legalize cannabis, joining Colorado and Washington, events that may point toward a national trend.

2238,"Many of today’s modern customer service departments are notorious for leaving customers with anything but service. Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer’s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer’s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand.

But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast!

While definitely not Comcast’s first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the Consumerist.

Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn’t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills – in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller.

An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn’t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal’s employer apparently intent on turning Conal’s complaints to Comcast against him.

This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal’s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter.

Conal says he’d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services.

In the end, Conal’s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal’s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees.

Conal, meanwhile, says he’s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won’t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either.

So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast.

The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn’t seem to hold any water in Conal’s dealings with Comcast.

But Business Insider reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn’t the first victim of Comcast’s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.

Below, please enjoy some of Comcast’s more well-known, documented, customer service fails.

The 71-years old priest, identified as, Father John Micheal O’neal, claims he went to heaven and met God, whom he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure. ‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting, she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. ‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!’ Despite the shocking revelation, which is being received with a bit of confusion in the Catholic world, Father O’neal says he still wishes to continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ‘Holy Mother’. ‘I wish to continue preaching.

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pickup truck, which now carries an anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

Subsequently, his company, Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pickup truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at its office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told the Galveston Daily News. “People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists. We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.”

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal from the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

By contrast, his killer was a convicted criminal who was on the terror watchlist and had his passport confiscated.

It was chance that brought the two men together, when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, launched his attack as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 25, stood guard at Ottawa’s war memorial, just metres away from the national parliament.

Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo dead before running into parliament, only to be killed himself by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared the act a “terror attack” as he said that Canadians would not be intimidated by such actions.

The attack had particular potency, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by Muslim convert Martin Rouleau-Couture.

Corporal Cirillo’s aunt has described him as a “wonderful young man,” who joined the cadets in his hometown of Hamilton as an adolescent, and went on to enlist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

In a cruel twist, he was carrying out a short rotation of just one month as a guard at the war memorial. The position was created seven years ago after a string of vandalism attempts.

“He was a wonderful young man. Not an enemy in the world,” Cpl. Cirillo’s aunt, told the Globe and Mail newspaper

She said her nephew was devoted to his six-year-old son, and spent almost all of his spare time with his family, and working out, she said. “He was into being fit. And being a father and a son.”

Zehaf-Bibeau, on the other hand, had a criminal record in Quebec and British Columbia. The son of a Libyan mother and Quebecoise mother, he has convictions for drug possession and robbery.

He was recently designated a “high risk traveller” by the Canadian government, and his passport was seized.

OTTAWA: Ottawa attacker on terror watchlist

His mother Susan is the deputy chairman of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Radio Canada has reported.

Police said in the initial hours after the shootings that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part. But as the day wore on, the cordon around Parliament was eased, employees were allowed to go home, and the sense of urgency appeared to wane.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

Witnesses said Corporal Cirillo was gunned down at point-blank range just before 10 am by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, his face half-covered. They said the gunman appeared to raise his arms in triumph, then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

DEFENCE: ADF chief warns against complacency

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside and barricaded doors with chairs as police with rifles and body armour took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Video footage posted online by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police ducking for cover as they advanced along a stone hallway, loud gunfire echoing among parliament’s stone columns.

Reporters in Canada said that if the gunman had turned left as he ran into the building, he would have entered the room where a caucus meeting was being held.

Colonel Geordie Elms, a former commanding officer of the Argylls, told The Globe and Mail that his “heart just fell” when he saw the regiment’s distinctive gold leopard badge on the shot soldier on television broadcasts. “That could only be one unit,” he said he thought at the time.

Because the guard role is considered ceremonial, Mr Cirillo’s gun probably was not loaded, he said.

Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina told the newspaper he had visited Corpl Cirillo’s family, who had told him that he was excited to be a part of the army.

“He was so proud of it,” he said, “and looked really great wearing the Argylls kit.”

""I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter claimed. ""There's nobody talking about it.""

""If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he continued.

One source close to Hunter worked to walk back the comment, emphasizing that the congressman received a tip from a “high level” source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection who told him that a group of people with “suspected ISIS affiliation” –- even Americans who traveled to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army against President Bashar al-Assad –- were apprehended at the border.

The tip ""was from a confidential source with the Border Patrol,"" the source said in an email. ""[It’s] more accurate to say people with known associations. Not 'fighters' in the sense folks might immediately think.""

While DHS and several other congressional sources shot down the claim outright, a spokesman for Hunter said that the congressman fears ISIS sympathizers could easily melt into U.S. cities and breed home-grown terrorism.

“The Congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,” Joe Kasper, deputy chief of staff to Hunter, wrote in response to the DHS denial. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

What attorney Lopa Blumenthal claims is the sound of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson firing at the unarmed 18-year-old can be heard in two distinct bursts — at least six shots, a pause, and an additional four shots, according to a forensic audio expert — in the ten-second clip.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” says a lawyer who has previously represented the family of a police shooting victim.

(The foreground of the audio is a bit distracting. “You are pretty. You’re so fine. Just going on some of your videos. Okay, yeah,” says a man’s voice. As CNN’s Don Lemon put it, “Your client, uh, was having a video chat. With a friend. Doing normal … whatever you do.”)

Brown’s friend Dorian Johnson, who witnessed the shooting, has said Brown was shot first while struggling with Officer Wilson, and then again after running away as he turned back with his hands up. However, “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well, I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again,’” offered CNN host and attorney Van Jones.

An autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family found that the teenager was shot at least six times, four times in the right arm and twice in the head, all in the front."
2251,"HAVANA (AP) — Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castrowas last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning.

This weekend, an image allegedly depicting a Durex pumpkin-spice-flavored condom circulated around social media, exciting basic white girls and the people who want to have sex with them.

Because safe sex is important, no matter what season it is. 🎃 #pumpkinspice pic.twitter.com/kzHSBgw87a

But as a basic white girl who handed over real American currency last night in exchange for a pumpkin-spice-scented Yankee candle at the Bed Bath and Beyond in Tribeca, it truly pains me to break this news to you: Pumpkin-spice condoms aren't real.

After originally keeping mum about the potential product, Durex provided the following statement to BuzzFeed's Basic White Girl vertical:

""Durex has heard that people are saying we launched a ‘Pumpkin Spice’ condom. We can’t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.""

West, who is more famous for his marriage and storming the stage to protest when Beyoncé doesn’t win than for his music these days first caused this kind of controversy back in 2009. Yeezus stormed the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards when Taylor Swift was given the Video of The Year for “You Belong With Me,” over Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.”
“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said while interrupting her acceptance speech, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”
On Sunday night, Kanye again took to the stage, this time when Beck beat out Beyoncé for Album of the Year. He left before he could say anything, but after the broadcast he made his feelings on that particular award very clear.
Kanye very angrily spouted off about “true artistry” and said “Beck should respect true artistry and give his award to Beyoncé.”
After those disrespectful comments, Kanye was allegedly called to task by the powers that be at the Grammys and he and his sex tape famous wife were permanently banned.
Whether this is true or not remains to be seen. It would be delightful if it was true and send a message to Kanye that he is, in fact, not the guy who gets to say who wins the awards. Beyoncé is great, but she isn’t the only artist out there"
2256,"New footage of the elusive yeti, captured amid the snowfields of Russia, is sparking renewed debate about the creature’s existence, as some see definitive proof while others claim the video is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

A group of Russian researchers set out after the yeti, traveling to the south-western Adygeya Republic after local news detailed sightings of the creature, according to the Daily Mail. The yeti had reportedly been spotted just an hour’s drive away from the city of Adygeisk. After arriving in the area, the team interviewed witnesses at a local mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen the yeti.

“I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house,” local witness Andrei Kazarian recalled. “Although we didn’t see anyone, we saw its huge footprints. They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.”

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova described the yeti as bearlike, though markedly different.

“The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.”

Setting out to investigate, the group were stunned to hear crunching snow, before spotting the yeti moving through the trees. As the Mirror reports, they claim to have then captured footage of the yeti, evidence that has since been handed over to local scientists for analysis.

The yeti video has already proven to be controversial, with some observers claiming that the sighting is nothing more than a stunt designed to bring tourists into the Russian town. Others, however, have asserted that the clip represents genuine proof of the yeti’s existence.

Last year, a DNA study conducted by Oxford professor Bryan Sykes failed to identify definitive proof of the yeti from hair samples. As the Inquisitr previously reported, however, Sykes was quick to assert that the study was meant to systematically examine yeti evidence, not pass judgement on its existence.

Hairy human-like beasts have been reported the world over, most famously in the United States, where the creatures are known as Bigfoot (or Sasquatch). In Russia, they are called either Almas or Yeti, names which may denote two distinct species.

2257,"(Reuters) - Historians on Thursday opened up a 113-year-old time capsule that had been hidden in a statue of a lion atop Boston's Old State House, and discovered a small red hardcover book tucked inside a copper box.

The book was not opened immediately due to its age and its contents were still unclear, but Bostonian Society President Brian LeMay pronounced himself ""absolutely thrilled"" by the find, which was not expected.

A Boston Daily Globe article from 1901, the year the capsule was placed in the statue atop the 301-year-old building, had described its contents as including letters from elected officials and buttons from the presidential campaigns of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

 
  
The red-brick, white-steepled Old State House, located in downtown Boston, is near the site of the 1770 Boston Massacre, which set the 13 colonies on the path to revolution and is a common stop for tourists visiting the city."
2260,"A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV. It was, in fact, by a satirical news site."

Say What? ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across the Border’

Rep. Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, does not seem like a nut job or prone to wild exaggerations. But last night he said something that should make jaws drop:

Van Susteren: Hold on. Stop for one second.

Hunter: They are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

Van Susteren: Let me ask a question. You say that they are coming in the southern border, which changes all the dynamics Do you have any information that they are coming in through the southern border now?

Hunter: Yes.

Van Susteren: Tell me what you know.

Hunter: At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.

Van Susteren: How do you know that?

Hunter: Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.

Van Susteren: And the border patrol just let’s ISIS members come across the border?

Hunter: No. They caught them at the border. Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them, you know that there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol. That’s how you know. That’s where we are at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border. Once again, they don’t have a navy, air force, nuclear weapons. The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islam — Chairman Dempsey said the same thing. He said that’s where the major threat is here, that’s how these guys are going to infiltrate through America and harm Americans.

Then add this comment by a House Democrat:

Rep. Tim Bishop (D., N.Y.) warned during a recent speech that up to 40 radicalized U.S. citizens who have fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL or ISIS) have already returned to the United States, where they could pose a terrorist threat.

Bishop claims that of the 100 or so Americans who have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIL’s ranks, some 40 have returned and are currently being surveilled by the FBI, according to his remarks, which were filmed and uploaded to YouTube last week.

“One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,” Bishop said during the speech. “It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.”

“It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country,” Bishop said, eliciting shocked responses from some in the crowd.

Is the threat of ISIS terrorists crossing our southern border no longer theoretical? Could the administration really successfully cover up something as big as this?"

2264,"MANAGUA, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- A Nicaraguan commission charged with investigating a possible meteorite crash over the weekend presented an initial report and rock samples on Tuesday.

The rocks, taken from a crater left by the impact in the eastern part of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday, were not from the meteorite, but some could contain material left behind by the space body, commission member Wilfred Strauch told reporters at a press conference.

""Researchers will be collecting more samples of rocks and nearby trees"" for analysis, Strauch said.

Strauch, who works for the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (Ineter), said researchers were seeking international help to figure out what caused the explosion on Sept. 6.

The Nicaraguan government announced on Sunday that a loud explosion that frightened residents could have come from a meteorite that fell near Managua's international airport. A crater measuring 12 meters across was left on the ground.

The incident coincided with the passing of a small asteroid, the 2014 RC, near the Earth on the same day.

Also on Tuesday, an expert with the U.S. space agency NASA, Don Yeomans, said it was unlikely that a piece of rock had separated from the asteroid as it whooshed past the Earth.

NASA experts also said the fact that no local residents reported seeing a fireball in the sky prior to the crash means it was not a meteorite.

Strauch said those observations were ""very interesting and important,"" adding Nicaragua will invite experts from NASA and other countries, such as Uruguay, to spend a month investigations at the site."
2265,"In further trouble for Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, Punjab and Haryana High Court has ordered a CBI probe into the allegations of forced castration of his followers inside the ashram. Justice K Kannan of the High Court passed the order on a petition filed by Hansraj Chauhan, a former follower of the Dera.

In his petition, Chauhan had claimed that he along with around 400 saints of 'dera' were castrated inside the ashram, Chauhan's counsel Navkiran Singh said.

Chauhan said in the petition that they were assured that those who would get castrated will be able to meet God through the dera head.

Taking cognizance of the petition, the HC had earlier ordered medical examination of petitioner Chuahan from the government multi-specialty hospital (GMSH) at Sector-16, Chandigarh.

The GMSH authorities examined Chauhan and found that he has been castrated, Singh said.

Seeking a CBI probe, Chauhan has also claimed before the High Court that castration process of dera followers is being done by Gurmeet Ram Rahim through doctors are employed in his hospital.

Besides, in a report submitted before the High Court, the state government said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons, associated with the dera head, in which all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated, Singh said.

The dera chief, who is going to hit the big screen next month with his film 'Messenger of God (MSG)', has already courted controversy with Sikh organisations, including Akal Takht, seeking a ban on it.

He has not only played the lead role in the movie but also produced it and sang songs.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim is also facing trial in courts in connection with a case of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples."
2266,"Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) claimed Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 Islamic State fighters were apprehended while attempting to enter the U.S. at its southern border.

The San Diego Republican said U.S. Border Patrol ""sources"" told him that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""

""If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border -- it’s that simple,"" he said. ""They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he said on Fox News’ ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.""

""ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border -- which they already have.""

Two of the country's top intelligence officials said last month they had no credible evidence to support the theory that militants are operating next door, nor that they are plotting to sneak across the border.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that Hunter's claim otherwise was ""categorically false.""

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Huffington Post. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, isn't the first member of Congress to raise the alarm about the prospect of extremists crossing the border. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested last month that such infiltration was possible, and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said it was already happening. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has also sounded similar notes about terrorists crossing his state's border from Mexico. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, claimed Tuesday that extremists were actively collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to infiltrate the U.S. border and attack Arkansans.

Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman for Hunter said the information came for a ""high level source"" and that DHS was ""actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper told The Huffington Post. ""And as for DHS’ statement, it makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change. No surprise there."""

With all the bad news coming out of Syria, Iraq, and the Ukraine, it’s easy to forget that the United States still has thousands of troops on the ground in Afghanistan. While a new combat theater has opened up in the Levant, the fight to vanquish the Taliban and the remnants of the Afghan insurgency rolls on as the longest war in American history finally winds down.

Just last year, one Marine team was conducting a “joint helicopter raid” in Helmand Province when they crossed the sights of a Taliban sniper. The phrase “my life flashed before my eyes” has been used and abused in our culture, but when one of these men kneels down to inspect the hole in his Kevlar helmet, he embodies that feeling.

The Iraqi government had said she was not married to the Islamist leader.

The woman, identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, tried to enter Lebanon over a week ago accompanied by two sons and a daughter when she was detained by border guards.

Machnouk claims al-Dulaimi is pregnant but the child is not al-Baghdadi’s.

“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [al-Baghdadi’s] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Machnouk told MTV.

Machnouk said the children were staying at a care center while al-Dulaimi was being interrogated.

2271,"French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be ""lucky"" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015.

2272,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government, and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he said, laughing. ""In this war, there is no going back.""

Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her ""sisters.""

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

2273,"When Tim Cook unveiled the Apple Watch back in September, its official launch date was set as the oh-so-vague “Spring 2015.” Now, we have our first guess as to what that launch date could actually look like. 9to5Mac reports that the Apple Watch is set to ship in the U.S. by the end of March, with Apple Store retail training scheduled for mid February.

According to the report, Apple will be sending representatives from Apple Stores to Apple’s offices in Cupertino or Austin, Texas to learn about the Watch, which will better prepare store employees for when the Watch arrives. In addition, the report states that Apple is finishing up work on the Apple Watch’s software, battery life, and inductive charging mechanism.

No word if every version of the Watch will ship in March, and of course these dates could change, as we get closer to launch. But for now, I’m imagining the rose gold Watch Edition sitting (maybe not so) delicately on my left wrist. The basic Watch will start at $349."

2275,"When Apple released the first iPhone, it only came with Apple's pre-loaded applications.

A year later, Apple opened the ""App Store"", which allowed developers to make applications for the iPhone.

The App Store is probably the smartest thing Apple did for the iPhone. It created a rich ecosystem of applications that made the phone an indispensable tool for hundreds of millions of people. It also launched billions of dollars worth of new businesses. (Think Instagram, Uber, Snapchat, etc.)

With the Apple set to release an Apple Watch, a lot of people expect a similar thing is going to happen with third-party applications from developers.

Developers we've spoken with caution that people should temper expectations, at least initially. They say Apple is limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing early on in order to ensure a smooth launch and maintain battery life.

""I think Apple is taking a similar approach with the Apple Watch and iPhone, saying to themselves 'We don't have an option to fail on this,'"" Sumit Mehra, CTO of app studio Y Media Labs told Business Insider. ""So Apple is limiting all this nice stuff, all these sensors, NFC, haptics, heartbeat sensor, gyrometer — everything. Apple is only going to allow developers to do the basic stuff to just get the Apple Watch out there, because either it's not ready, or they don't know what the implications of something like this could be.""

Mehra says he thinks it all boils down the Apple's continued efforts to increase the battery life of the Apple Watch. Accessing sensors drains the battery life, so Apple is preventing developers from using these sensors in their apps to avoid launching a device with a lineup full of battery-hogging apps.

""Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don’t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it’s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours.""

Apple currently doesn't allow developers to create standalone apps for the Apple Watch, though Apple has promised it will open up WatchKit later this year. For now, apps offload all the heavy lifting and computations to the tethered iPhone, which saves battery and gives developers access to the iPhone's powerful processor.

What can Apple Watch apps do at this very moment? They can send actionable notifications, talk to your iPhone through app extensions, and present summary information in what Apple is calling ""glances.""

Markiyan Matsekh, who has been developing a third-party Tesla companion app for the Apple Watch at app-company Eleks, says the limitations have presented a challenge for developers.

""The general impression I’d say is that the Apple Watch didn’t match the expectations,"" Matsekh told Business Insider. ""We saw lots of fun stuff during the Apple Watch’s presentation, and in its description and marketing materials, but we didn’t find a way to implement them in real life. We had a vision of what we’d like to achieve, and in the end we had to get rid of lots of features because they just weren’t possible in the current state of WatchKit.""

Matsekh says the Eleks team was eventually able to create an app that was ""more or less fine,"" but says the current limitations mean ""it’s not as cool as we’d like it be.""

""It is possible to build something, but it’s much more limited than we’d expect,"" he says.

Matsekh originally wanted to use the Apple Watch's digital crown, the circular knob used as input on the watch, as a way for users to control the interior temperature of their Tesla. Apple's guidelines, however, state that you can only use the digital crown for scrolling or system features, so they had to scrap that and go with a second-best solution.

""What I think Apple is trying to do is to educate Apple Watch users of some basic user experience guidelines to try to make it as simple as possible,"" Matsekh says. ""That may have been the reason behind this. It’s not that they didn’t have the time or resources to make these features available, I think it was a conscious choice to limit customization to make the apps follow the guidelines and make them simpler for users.""

""Any engineer would say that Apple is just trying to conserve battery life so that the user has a good experience,"" Y Media Labs CTO Sumit Mehra says. ""As a developer, do I like it? Probably not. But do I like it as a user? Absolutely, because at the end of the day I don’t want to be charging my watch twice a day.""

It's no secret that battery life is still a major concern for app developers, and nobody knows how long the Apple Watch will last before it needs a charge. Developers are estimating between 19 and 24 hours, but Apple has yet to announce specifics.

For Matsekh, one thing is for certain: ""If this watch doesn’t live a day, it doesn’t have any chance of survival."""
2276,"First customers complained that their new iPhone 6s were bending.

Now owners of the new Apple gadget have said when they make a phone call - it is ripping out their hair.

The new controversy, branded by social media users as 'hairgate', follows allegations people are getting their beard or head hair 'snagged' when the phone is held against their face.

Claims: Chad Coleman was one of the first people to raise the issue on Twitter after complaining that his 'scruff' was being ripped

Anger: Scott Bilsky blamed the seam where the aluminium meets the glass on his hair being pulled out

Scandal: Hairgate is the latest controversy following bendgate - where users said the phone was bending when it was placed in a skinny jeans pocket or sat on

They claim that the seam between the aluminium and glass screen is catching hairs and tearing them out.

It is the latest scandal, following on from 'bendgate', and has led to a flurry of angry posts on Twitter.

Chad Coleman said: 'Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it when I make calls.'

Paul Peavler said: 'The seam on my iPhone where the aluminium meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out.

The new allegations have also prompted a number of hoax adverts, suggesting the phone is good for shaving a woman's legs and trimming a man's facial hair.

Others have said the phone 'has it all' and can save you money on going to the hairdressers.

Earlier this month, the electronics giant were forced to respond to complaints the phones were bending.

Response: The latest complaint led to some creating mock adverts, one was as a beard trimmer for men

Smooth: Another involved a woman apparently shaving her legs using the iPhone 6

Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.'

The new phones face criticism over their bendability, dubbed 'bendgate.' Social media and online forums have been filled with comments about how the new phones can bend when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans.

Apple said its iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry.

The only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time, said Laban Roomes, chief executive officer of Goldgenie, which customizes and gold plates iPhones.

Problem: Paul Peavler, blaming the design of the phone for the issue, referred to the problem as 'seamgate'

Attribute: Mo Jiwa put a positive spin on the newest perceived flaw saying the iPhone 6 is now the phone that 'does it all'

Economical: Another social media user said the problem could provide assistance to personal finances, as it would save you money on going to a hairdresser"
2277,"Apple took the leap into the wearable space with the announcement of its Apple Watch earlier in September this year, revealing that the device will start at $349. Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known."

Nelson's 'death' was reported by Foxnews.es, a hoax website which has no affiliation with the television news network.

The fake story claimed that the actor, best known for his roles in 80's classics The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo’s Fire, had been found dead on Saturday night at Sierra Towers, a West Hollywood condominium block.

By Sunday morning Nelson’s name had become a trending topic on Facebook and his agent was prompted to issue a denial.

Gregg Klein even issued a photo of the actor holding up a copy of Sunday's L.A. Times along with a note, ‘Reports of Judd Nelson's death are not accurate please see attached photo.’

It isn't known how or why the fake reports emerged.

Nelson's longtime manager Jean-Pierre Henraux told the Times that the actor doesn’t even live at the reported address.

2280,"Mark Oberholtzer isn't an Islamic fighter in Syria. He's never been to Syria. And the plumber from Texas City, Texas, says he certainly would never willingly aid fundamentalist rebels.

So it's hard for him to understand how his Ford F-250 pickup truck - including his logo for Mark-1 Plumbing and his phone number - wound up being in a photo posted on Twitter by the extremist Ansar al-Deen Front from the front lines of the war in Syria.

Mr Oberholtzer says he's been getting hundreds of phone calls and faxes since the Ansar al-Deen Front tweeted a picture of what appeared to be his old truck with an anti-aircraft gun in the back, according to the Galveston County Daily News.

However, it remains to be seen if the photo is entirely authentic, with a new video surfacing which suggests the photo could have been digitally altered.

Scroll down for video

This truck, once owned by Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City, Texas, is seen here in an Islamist propaganda photo. It's unclear if it has gone all the way to Syria or whether the photo has been digitally altered

This photo, taken from a propaganda video, shows a near identical scene featuring a different truck, raising questions as to the authenticity of the photo featuring Mr Oberholtzer's truck

The Islamist forces fighting across the region are known for their advanced and technical digital propaganda campaigns.

The video, featuring a different vehicle firing from exactly the same position, raises the possibility Mr Oberholtzer's vehicle may have been photoshopped into a video frame.

Superimposing a better vehicle and gun into a still frame from the original video would be significantly easier than trying to alter the video itself.

This could be why the video features an older model car and weapon, but the photo features Mr Oberholtzer's later-model Toyota.

Despite this, people have now been making hateful phone calls to Mr Oberholtzer's company in the mistaken belief he is supporting the fundamentalists.

'A few of the people are really ugly,' he told the newspaper.

Some threatened his life.

Mr Oberholtzer says he has hired a lawyer and wants to make Twitter remove the posting, CBS News reports.

He says he sold the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago.

In the past when he sold his work trucks, he always removed the logo first. The last time he got rid of a vehicle he didn't.

Mark Oberholtzer says he has no idea how Islamists in Syria could have got hold of his truck

Mr Oberholtzer, who has worked as a plumber for the past 32-years, assumed AutoNation would remove the decal before selling the truck.

Apparently it didn't.

It's still unknown how the truck could have made its way into the possession of Islamist fighters in Syria.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction, and probably different owners over and over, before it may have ended up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Oberholtzer wants the death threats and the phone to stop ringing.

'We have a secretary here, she's scared to death. We all have families. We don't want no problems,' said Oberholtzer.

CBS News reports that the band of Ansar al-Deen seen in the photo mostly hail from Chechnya in Russia.

While most fighters are Islamic extremists, the group has not reportedly allied itself with ISIS in Syria.

ISIS: The terror group has expanded how and why it recruits new members and is specifically targeting sympathizers abroad

And while it is not known how fighters with ISIS could have come to own a Texan plumber's truck, the terror group is trying to expand how it recruits fighters to its ranks.

The extremist organization also has been targeting its sophisticated propaganda to entice potential wives and professionals such as doctors, accountants and engineers in its efforts to build a new society.

Among those it has lured were three teenage girls from Colorado, who set out for Syria this fall after swapping Twitter messages about marriage and religion with IS recruiters, and a young woman who sought to fight there - or failing that, to use her nursing skills. It's a diverse pool of recruits whose motives perplex Western governments seeking to combat the flow.

The group 'is issuing a bit of a siren song through social media, trying to attract people to their so-called caliphate,' FBI Director James Comey told reporters. 'And among the people they're trying to attract are young women to be brides for these jihadis.'

The group conscripts children for battle, recruits Westerners for acts of jihad and releases videotapes of beheadings. But it also uses propaganda with a humanitarian appeal, such as photos of bombed-out Syrian villages coupled with pleas for help. Video images of smiling children being given treats and enjoying stuffed animals paint a family-friendly portrait that suggests roles within the proto-state for wives and mothers.

Justice Department officials say people aiding the Islamic State understand what they're getting into and risk prosecution, whether or not they venture to Syria and even if they don't plan to take up arms themselves. Prosecutors have criminally charged more than 15 people in connection with supporting Islamic militant groups.

Advance: Militant Islamist fighters wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of Syria's northern Raqqa province in June

A Rochester, New York, food store owner stands accused of trying to arrange for others to travel to Syria and of plotting to kill members of the U.S. military. An Illinois man, allegedly determined to join militants, left behind a letter saying he was disgusted by Western society. And prosecutors say a North Carolina man asked Allah online for martyrdom.

Most charges are brought under a statute that makes it illegal to provide 'material support' - including money, training or a false identity - to a designated terrorist group. Defense lawyers argued the law is overly broad and ensnares the misguided as often as it sweeps up the dangerous. Courts, however, have accepted an expansive interpretation of the law.

'We need to make clear that if you want to go over there and join a terrorist group, you're likely to end up instead in jail,' Carlin said.

Justice Department officials say they're also trying strategies other than prosecution, including trying to identify potential recruits before they go.

FBI agents in Colorado met repeatedly with Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old nurse's aide who had converted to Islam, hoping to dissuade her from traveling to Syria to marry a militant suitor she met online. Agents suggested she try humanitarian work instead of jihad, but she told them that if she couldn't fight, she would use her skills as a nurse's aide to help militant fighters, according to court documents.

Conley pleaded guilty in September and faces sentencing next month. Her lawyer, Robert Pepin, has said she was 'led terribly astray' while pursuing her religion and was 'saved' by her arrest.

Perhaps no case better shows the penetration of the recruitment campaign than that of the three Colorado girls, all from East African immigrant families, who were radicalized online and headed for Syria in October.

The self-styled 'caliphate' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain

A review of the girls' social media use, which included thousands of Twitter messages and postings on other sites, by the SITE Intelligence Group shows they were in contact with online jihadists from around the world and were deeply interested in marriage and the role of women. As recruiters interacted with the girls, their typical teenage banter about friends and school became replaced with discussions of religion, paradise and death, the review showed.

Six months before they went overseas, one girl wrote that she wanted to get married as soon as possible and her friends wished her well, telling her they hoped she got an 'amazing husband because you do not deserve anything else!'

One female recruiter told prospects to expect to marry quickly and expect to live a domestic life, as it is 'completely impossible for women to participate in battle,' according to SITE. Women are expected to marry the fighters and bear their children, she explained. Another recruiter told a 16-year-old girl who inquired about joining that 'everyone is welcome,' according to the report.

U.S. officials say even comparatively benign motives for supporting the Islamic State are troubling. 'I'm not sure we've seen someone who's gone over there who's not attracted to the jihadi cause,' Carlin said."

Eyewitnesses said an armed man with long black hair emerged at the war memorial, fired about four times‎, and a guard went down. The gunman then ran toward Parliament Hill. The shooting victim was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Police have sealed off the area.

Police locked down Parliament and Ottawa Police tactical officers arrived, pointing guns at journalists and ordering them to the ground. Journalists were put into lockdown at the foyer in front of the House of Commons. Police were warning the public to stay away from Parliament Hill and the war memorial.

Reporters saw a body lying on the floor outside the Library of Parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper “is safe and has left Parliament Hill,” Jason MacDonald, his director of communications, said via Twitter.

Amid the chaos, MPs were among those taking cover. Michelle Rempel, a Conservative MP from Calgary, used Twitter to communicate with the outside world: “Mom im okay Im in hiding.” She also tweeted: “is it clear people? shots were outside caucus room”.

It appears that officers were searching the building. One body was visible outside the library of parliament, roughly in the middle of Centre Block, but it was unclear if that was a suspect or a law enforcement official.

2283,"Wanted: Islamic State group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a $US10 million price on his head, delivers a sermon at a mosque in Iraq in July. Photo: AP

Beirut: The second wife of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is under interrogation in military detention in Lebanon after she was arrested in the north of Lebanon 10 days ago, security officials revealed on Tuesday.

It is unclear whether she was fleeing the self-proclaimed caliph of the extremist Sunni group, or if she remains loyal to Baghdadi and was simply in hiding, experts said.

Working with Western intelligence services, the Lebanese army tracked Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi citizen, and her son to an undisclosed location north of the strife-ridden city of Tripoli, one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. Another source said she was captured in the northern border town of Arsal.

Her capture and detention could prove to be a significant setback for Baghdadi as she may be used as leverage to negotiate the release of the many prisoners – both foreign, Iraqi and Syrian – that the Islamic State is holding.

Lebanese security officials also hope her capture could be the breakthrough needed to secure the release of at least 26 Lebanese soldiers kidnapped by IS and Nusra Front militants in August.

A DNA test had confirmed the child, believed to be nine years old, is Baghdadi's son, the Lebanese al-Safir newspaper said, citing security officials.

It is believed Baghdadi's DNA may have been taken by US officials during the nine months he was held in an American-run prison in Iraq in 2004 after his capture in Fallujah

However in a sign of the confusion surrounding the arrests, some media sources reported the child in custody was a girl.

Dulaimi was one of 140 women released from a Syrian government jail in March this year as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Greek Orthodox nuns held by al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in the Syrian town of Maaloula.

Since her release she is believed to have moved around the border area between Lebanon and Syria, sticking mostly to the mountainous territory held by the Nusra Front, said Mario Abou Zeid, a research analyst with the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut.  ""She was infiltrating the Lebanese borders, moving inside and outside Lebanon with fake IDs … in the area controlled by Nusra Front,"" Mr Abou Zeid said. ""She maintained a very low profile, protecting herself and her son.""  He warned that Dulaimi's capture, while an important step, may be of limited value to intelligence services given the Islamic State was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle.  ""The main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to.  ""Some may think she has all the secrets of Baghdadi, even though she was captured in the Syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from Baghdadi, on the run along the Lebanese-Syrian border.""  It is possible Dulaimi had been away from Baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to Lebanon ""could have been a defection from Baghdadi, she could have been fleeing"", Mr Abou Zeid told Fairfax Media.  She is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry in the Yarze district, north of Beirut, the unnamed official said.  There is no doubt the counter-terrorism operation, which involved both Lebanese, US and European intelligence agencies, will prove useful, said retired Lebanese general and security analyst, Elias Farhat.  ""She is one of the wives of the so-called caliph of the Islamic State … she will be useful in the negotiations between the Lebanese authorities as IS and Jabhat al-Nusra in relation to the kidnapped soldiers,"" General Farhat said.  ""Her capture is one of the successful outcomes of cooperation between Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies.""  But even as news of Dulaimi's capture broke over Lebanon, local media reported late on Tuesday that militants had attacked a Lebanese army patrol in Ras Baalbek, with a four-man unit feared harmed or kidnapped.  It is believed Baghdadi became head of the Islamic State of Iraq, a predecessor to IS, in 2010. It then expanded into Syria in 2013 and in June Islamic State militants took control of Iraq's second city of Mosul before moving south towards the capital.  There were reports last month that he had been killed in US-led airstrikes in Iraq, although soon after the Islamic State released a recording on November 13 – purportedly by Baghdadi – in which he called for ""volcanos of jihad"" to be unleashed over the world.

The US Government has offered a $US10 million ($11.84 million) reward for his capture."

Someone call Nicholas Cage because Bostonians may have just discovered a new real-life national treasure.

A time capsule from 1795 in the form of a small copper box was unearthed in Massachusetts statehouse in Boston Thursday. The container was first placed in the cornerstone of the building on Beacon Hill by revolutionary war hero Paul Revere and the then-governor of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams.

The cigar-box sized capsule will be x-rayed over the weekend and its contents revealed next week. The artifact is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in Massachusetts, making it by default one of the oldest such items in the United States.

2290,"Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) to a six-foot mechanical bear.

The polar bear, named Bernard, is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers-by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints”.

However, a press officer for the council told i100.co.uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order, or anything like that”.

The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance.

We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation.

The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.

Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday, which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC, has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying: “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’.”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour, vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night”. Sadly, it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter."
2293,"An Australian tourist’s holiday in Bali ended horrifyingly when doctors were forced to pull a tropical spider out of his stomach.

Medical staff at Bali International Medical Centre said the spider had burrowed itself into Dylan Thomas’s skin through a scar from where his appendix had been removed.

The 21-year-old, from Bunbury, Western Australia, told NT News he woke up on Saturday morning to find a 2-inch red trail rising up from his stomach.

Later that day it had risen two or three inches higher up his body, he said.

When he first went to doctors on Sunday they told him it was an insect bite and gave him some cream, NT News reported.

By Monday morning the trail had started to blister.

Then Thomas saw a dermatologist, who recognised things were not right.

Doctors operated and removed a spider the size of a match head from his body.

Thomas told NT News:

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated.

“It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.”

The spider, which was dead when it was removed, has been sent off for tests, and Thomas is expected to learn what species it was in the coming days. He summed up his experience on Thursday:

The Bunbury Mail said Thomas was now hoping his friends would help him raise enough money for a Spider-Man tattoo on his chest.

He is also apparently hoping the ordeal leaves a “gnarly scar” on his body.

update

A number of scientists in Perth have now cast doubt over Thomas’ claims and said the red trail may have been caused by a mite rather than a spider.

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau told WA Today: “We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_4050373"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-10-17 18:18:33 -0400', 'update'); });"
2295,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhindered

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'"
2296,"North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.

“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,” said the leader of the Catholic Church, according to Italian news sources. 

This is a significant pivot from the position held by Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. In 2008, he said that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on Earth.”

Francis has consistently made headlines with sometimes controversial remarks since assuming the papacy in 2013.

Vatican observers have called him a ""radical"" because of his open-mindedness and desire to reach out to ""the grassroots of Catholic life.""

The 77-year-old leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics has adopted more liberal positions than his predecessor, stirring up tensions with conservative Catholics on issues such as homosexuality and single motherhood. 

In one such instance in July 2013, Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality. 

""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil. 

Francis's papal name comes from St. Francis of Assisi, the church's patron saint of animals and the ecology."
2299,"A new survey from UBS suggests that the Apple Watch could get off to a strong start, leading the investment firm to predict sales of 24 million units and gross profit of $3.4 billion from the wearable device in its first few months alone.

In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability.

Detailing the results in a note to investors on Monday, analyst Steven Milunovich noted that the first version of the Apple Watch has a number of limitations, most notably its dependence on a connected iPhone for functionality. But he believes the first-generation device will set up Apple for long-term success in the wearables market.

Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. That would result in sales of $10.3 billion, and with an assumed 33 percent level of gross margin, would add $3.4 billion in profit to the company's bottom line for fiscal 2015.

Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season.

Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year.

The analyst said it's likely that the iPhone and Apple Watch will prove to be complementary products, much like the Mac and iPad. But he said it's also possible that the Apple Watch could eventually become the successor to the iPhone.

""Given that two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables,"" Mulinovich said. ""With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market.""

The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch.

Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market.

""Just as Apple wasn't the first MP3 or smartphone vendor but redefined those categories, we expect Apple Watch to become first to mind in smartwatches,"" he said.

UBS has maintained its ""buy"" rating for AAPL stock with a 12-month price target of $125."
2302,"Online reports in jihadi and Palestinian forums claim Gill Rosenberg was captured by Islamic State group in embattled town of Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, the Israeli-Canadian who joined Kurdish forces in their battles against the radical Islamic State terror group has been reportedly taken captive by the group, unconfirmed reports claimed.

Rosenberg, 31, is a civil aviation pilot who enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009, extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Rosenberg said that she had made contact with the Kurds through Facebook, asking them to allow her to join the Kurdish People's Protection Units, commonly known as the YPG.

On her Facebook page, Rosenberg shared her plans for her mission in Syria two months in advance, when she uploaded a picture from Jerusalem showing an Israeli flag next to an Islamic State flag, and continued posting images until her November 1, her final day in Israel.

She later posted pictures from Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan, and then from Erbil International Airport in Kurdistan. On November 9, she uploaded images from the Kurdish region of Syria and wrote, ""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means."" A friend wrote, ""Take care of yourself, friend. You are one strong woman, and you'll destroy the Islamic State.""

A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. She has crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited by YPG, the source said.

Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but it was turned off on Tuesday.

""That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,"" Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynecologist from Sarajevo, said, describing the growing trend as ""worrying.""

Apart from educational institutes, parents should also play a significant role in providing effective sex education, he said.

""It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences,"" he continued. ""We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""

According to the InSerba News Network, young girls in Bosnia are allegedly seeking advice from experts online. ""I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged,"" one girl wrote online.

2306,"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world."

And the Supreme Leader’s interest in the Scottish independence referendum means Scotland is high in his thoughts. Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.”

He said the restaurants were one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there."
2311,"Apple is reportedly aiming to sell upwards of 50 million Apple Watches in 2015.

The news comes via a new report from Digitimes, which claims that Apple has placed orders for shipments of up to five million AMOLED panels per month throughout the year. These screens will be used as the innovative touch-sensitive display for Apple’s wearables debut.

The panels are being sourced exclusively from LG, which is already a supplier for many Apple LCD panels, although it has not previously supplied the company with AMOLEDs.

The projected sales are on the top end of those suggested by Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, who previously said that the iWatch could achieve sales in the region of 30-60 million units in its first year on the market, thanks to the “halo effect” of brand loyalty to Apple that will drive sales of the product.

If Apple can sell 50 million+ Apple Watch devices that will make it the fastest selling new iOS device in history. The iPad, by comparison, sold 19.5 million units in its first year, while the iPhone moved a relatively paltry 5.4 million units.

The Apple Watch is set to arrive Q1 next year, with prices starting at $349."

Some have claimed that Pyongyang, the capital, has been shut down and Kim has fled the city.

""This sort of action suggests there has either been an attempted coup or that the authorities there have uncovered some sort of plot against the leadership,"" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda Universtity, told the Telegraph.

However South Korean media claim that Kim is still in control but struggling with a variety of illnesses with his sister acting as leader in his absence.

Yonhap suggest Kim, who came to power after the death of his father Kim Jong-il, is suffering from gout, diabetes and high blood pressure"".

Kim recently underwent surgery after breaking both his ankles following an arduous tour of military bases and factories in a pair of Cuban heels.

Western governments have responded sceptically to news Kim may have been forced out and described the endless rumours as wishful thinking.

In the upper-right window is a live feed from the tuner card. The source is TBS's SD feed via Dish Network. The lower-right is video playback from the digital recording, also recorded from Dish Network in 2003. I fed the audio from both the live feed and the video clip as well as the video from the S-video out on my video card to an external DVD recorder, then uploaded the final result to youtube. After 202 seconds of playback, the TBS live feed had advanced a full 15 seconds over the recording. This amounts to nearly 2 minutes over the course of a full episode.

2317,"Prosecutors say the FBI is trying to validate an audio recording that allegedly captured the police shooting of Michael Brown — including what sounds like a volley of six shots, a brief pause, and then another four or five shots. The unidentified man who made the recording says he was using a phone app to create a video text message at the same time the unarmed 18-year-old was killed in a midday confrontation with a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9, according to his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal. ""He didn’t know necessarily what was going on outside until later, and that’s when he put two and two together and realized he may have recorded what was going on at the time,"" Blumenthal said.

Blumenthal said the FBI has interviewed her client and listened to the recording, which was first reported by CNN. NBC News has obtained the recording but cannot independently verify that the sounds on it are linked to the Brown shooting, and the FBI had no comment. Autopsy reports say that Brown was shot at least six times, but up to 11 shots are heard on the recording. It's not clear why there was a pause in the middle, and the recording only contains 12 seconds of audio. ""We don't have any side that we're representing other than the fact that here's a piece of evidence that we want to get to the investigators which may lead to a more complete story,"" Blumenthal said."

The U.S. State Department is expected to issue more details about the raid in the coming hours, according to Al Jazeera.

Original story below

The sister of Luke Somers, the American photojournalist held captive by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, says that he was killed in a failed rescue attempt, Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

There are conflicting reports however, with the Reuters news agency reporting that Yemen's Defense Ministry said a raid by its forces Saturday freed a U.S. hostage, who was not named.

Lucy Somers, who said that she had heard the news from FBI agents, said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" according to a report from Sky News.

A joint military operation to free Somers, conducted by U.S. and Yemeni forces, was launched Saturday, according to a report from NBC News. The network added that Somers' status was unclear.

The reports come just hours after the Associated Press reported that 9 suspected al-Qaeda fighters were killed in a drone strike in Yemen.

Somers' mother and brother appeared in an video earlier this week, in which they called on his captors to “show mercy,” to him.

A video released earlier this week by Somers' captors, al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, showed a militant threatening to kill Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

There has been no official comment or confirmation of Somers' status.

2321,"OFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violence

ELON, N.C. – Elon University has dropped the term “freshman” from its vocabulary and replaced it with “first-year,” a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.

Leigh-Anne Royster, director of Elon’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing,” said in an email to The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term “freshman” is outdated, and that replacing “freshman” with “first year” is a “celebration of diversity.”

Royster stated the word “freshman” naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as “freshman.” With that, Royster stated “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Royster said. “Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.”

Royster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.

“Using language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,” she said. “Moving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.”

At this semester’s student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called “first-years.” No public announcement was made regarding this change — administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.

Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said “freshman” in training, he or she was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” Schukraft said. “They were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.”

But when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term “freshman.”

But Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.

Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elon’s core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe “freshmen” is a “sexist” term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. “ ‘Freshman’ isn’t necessarily wrong, but it’s not completely applicable to Elon’s entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.”

College Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.

'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says. 
Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer, with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner.
She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship.

Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.
The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler.
The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them, and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41-years-old.
Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI.

In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 
'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 
'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 
'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 
'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.'
She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.

2325,"BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.

North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.

""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.

If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.

""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort"".

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were ""rubbish"".

""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.

Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition.

Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.

""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said.

2326,"Culkin is still the lead singer of a comedy band called Pizza Underground

Macaulay Culkin is again the subject of death hoaxes, with the latest alleging that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on Friday just seven months after the last rumour.

The claims about the actor and musician, who rose to fame after starring in the 1990 classic family comedy Home Alone and is now in a band called Pizza Underground, spread quickly on social media from Thursday.

The misleading report on MSNBC.website (not to be confused with the real MSNBC) said: ""Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.""

Fans of the former actor's work posted emotional tributes after hearing the false claims about his wellbeing.

""Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

""At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

""'The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,' said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department,"" the hoax statement added.

However, the actor's representatives cleared up the rumours on Friday and issued a statement saying that he is still alive.

They said: ""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. ""He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet.""

Pizza Underground perform Velvet Underground parody songs with pizza-themed lyrics and the five-man band have toured the UK and US.

In May this year, Macaulay stormed off stage during gig in Nottingham and cancelled the rest of his UK tour after he was booed and pelted with pints of beer by the audience during his kazoo solo performance.

He is also ranked second on VH1's ""100 Greatest Kid Stars"" after Shirley Temple and also starred in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and Richie Rich."
2327,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad."

2329,"Seattle/ San Francisco: Google Inc. bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group Llc and Blackstone Group Lp in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Centre office park in Redwood City, California, about 18 kilometres from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed on Thursday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details. The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing. “We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.” The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of 30 September, up almost 19% from a year earlier, the filing shows. Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site. Fitness centre The properties Google purchased comprise about 9,34,200 square feet of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness centre that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex. The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said. Pacific Shores Centre is a 106-acre waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge. Starwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Centre in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital Llc, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area. Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring. Blackstone, through its Equity Office unit, has major office holdings in Northern California and is the second-largest US office landlord, after Brookfield Property Partners Lp. Bloomberg"
2330,"Journeyman golfer Dan Olsen retracted claims Tiger Woods had been suspended by the PGA Tour for using performance-enhancing drugs after both the PGA Tour and Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, vehemently denied the claims. 

Olsen told ESPN.com's Michael Collins ""it was only my opinon,"" courtesy of ESPN.com's Bob Harig. ""Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any firsthand knowledge or facts,"" Olsen told ESPN.com. ""I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview, and I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour.""

Olsen certainly made several major allegations. Per Harig, Olsen claimed on 730AM The Game in Lansing, Michigan, that Woods had been suspended for a month due to the use of PEDs and that an exempt player he didn't name had revealed the information. He also claimed that Woods used a ""cheater ball.""

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,"" Olsen told the station, per Harig. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Steinberg in a statement earlier, courtesy of Harig. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.""

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, added that, ""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations.""

However, the PGA Tour told Harig that if a player tested positive for PEDs, they were required to announce the suspension, while any punishments for recreational drugs remain undisclosed. 

Olsen's original claims, or opinions, are certainly inflammatory and it remains to be seen if he will be reprimanded

Until now, Woods has only had his character called into question by critics for his past transgressions, while his professional achievements were still held in esteem."

2334,"Authorities unearthed on Saturday unmarked graves containing a number of bodies on the outskirts of a southern Mexico town where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, told reporters ""pits with bone remains"" had been found outside Iguala, 125 miles south of Mexico City.

""It's hard to be sure that it's the missing students because we must conduct expert tests and find similarities with the people being searched,"" a state police agent at the scene told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The graves were in rough terrain in a hillside community that is part of the Iguala municipality. Police kept reporters far from the site.

The 43 students disappeared last weekend after Iguala municipal officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return to their teacher training college near the state capital Chilpancingo.

Three students were killed. Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

Witnesses told AFP that the officers took away several students in patrol cars after the shooting. One witness said he saw 30 to 40 people taken away.

The officers are suspected of having links to criminal gangs, raising fears about the students' fate in a country where drug cartels often bury their victims in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

Another police official said the pits on the outskirts of Iguala were found thanks to an anonymous phone tip.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

Authorities have detained 22 Iguala officers over the shootings and issued arrest warrants for the town's mayor and security chief, both of whom have disappeared.

The United Nations has urged Mexican authorities to conduct an ""effective and diligent"" search for the missing, calling the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times.""

Dozens of police officers, soldiers and investigators were deployed to the area after the graves were found.

Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico, with gangs known as ""Guerreros Unidos"" and ""Los Rojos"" engaged in bloody turf wars."
2336,"Multi-millionaire religious ""guru"" Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh persuaded around 400 of his estimated 50 million followers worldwide to cut off their own testicles to ""bring them closer to God"".  The details of the bizarre incident have only just come to light despite reportedly taking place in 2000 at a hospital run by Ram Rahim in India.  India's Central Bureau of Investigation has reportedly accused Ram Rahim of grievous bodily harm and he is under investigation. He has previously been questioned over the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and has also been accused of sexual assault by female followers but has never been charged.  Navkiran Singh, who is the lawyer for Hans Raj Chauhan, the only castration victim so far to come forward, said his client and other victims believed they would become social outcasts if they refused to perform the ""operation"" demanded of them by Ram Rahim. ""They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,"" said Navkiran, in a report in the Daily Mail.  Ram Rahim, 47, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m. The guru stars in a spectacular new movie, Messenger of God, in which he appears to walk on air, tear tree trunks in half and perform other miracles. Though 157,000 people are thought to have attended the film's premiere in Gurgaon, near Delhi, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the revelations have caused sales of tickets for the movie to dwindle dramatically.  Gurus are big business in India, where their endorsements can help political parties get elected, and where millions of people seek spiritual guidance every year. Sathya Sai Baba, who was said to be able to conjure ash from thin air, was worth an estimated US$7bn when he died.  Even after death, some gurus retain a hold over devotees. Ashutosh Maharaj, who was certified deceased by medical examiners last year, has had his body frozen by followers who apparently believe he is merely in a state of deep meditation called ""samadhi"".

An Iraqi official told the Associated Press that the woman detained in Lebanon was not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim has clarified that the woman identified as Saja Abdul Hamid al Dulaimi, is an Iraqi national who travelled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon and not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The report noted that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al Dulaimi.
The Iraqi official said that she is the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is held in Iraq as a terror suspect.
The Lebanese Army officials claimed on Tuesday that they had detained the wife and son of Islamic State leader and self-proclaimed Caliph Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi.
She is being interrogated at the Lebanese Defense Ministry, according to Lebanese media As-Safir reports Reuters.
This is not the first time that the name Saja Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi has appeared in the media. In July reports had claimed that Saja Abdul Hamid al Dulaimi was part of an exchange deal in which ISIS released captured nuns. It was found that al Dulaimi, along with her children and younger brother, was released by the Syrian government as part of the exchange.?
Reports of al-Baghdadi's family being released in exchange for the nuns were first leaked by Abu Maan al-Suri, a member of the ISIS rival-front Nusra, to Lebanese TV channel LBCI News."
2338,"AUSTRALIA — A man in Australia has been dubbed “Spider Man” after a bizarre turn of events during a trip to Bali.

A mark on Dylan Maxwell’s belly may look like a gruesome scar, but he says it’s actually the trail left by a spider that burrowed under his skin.

The tiny tropical spider burrowed through a small appendix scar and traveled up into his torso, leaving a red, scar-like trail from his naval to his chest. It survived there for three days.



Maxwell was visiting Indonesia when he says noticed what he thought was a scratch about an inch-long.

He went to a doctor who told him it was a small insect bite, but the trail kept growing up toward his chest.

Maxwell described it as “a very searing, hot searing burning sensation. It was like nothing I’ve ever felt before.”

When it started to blister, he says he got worried.

That’s when they realized the spider has crawled in through the scar.

He says doctors were able to pull the spider out. The spider was placed in a container and shipped off for testing.



Still, many are unconvinced because Dylan has not produced records of the account. And experts say that there aren’t really accounts of spiders burrowing inside people skins. Snopes.com has some discussion about Dylan’s claim.

I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might ‘crawl beneath skin through a scar’. The claim that it was ‘feeding and moving up through the scar tissue’ defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also skeptical because the ‘evidence’ (the spider itself) is not presented."

The Hollywood Reporter stated on Nov. 8, 2014, that Culkin has been the victim of yet another celebrity death hoax. No matter how many times the Internet may claim him to be dead, he just keeps on living and quietly enjoying life.

An article from a fake MSNBC website actually claims that the 34-year-old child star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. It states that a wellness check was requested by a family member and police went over to check on him and he was found dead. There is even a fake quote from the police.

""The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,"" said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

As rumors started being believed by those on social media, Twitter users began posting their mourning messages and condolences. This is the second time this year that people have believed the ""Macaulay Culkin is dead"" hoax and about the fifth time in the past two years.

The first time it happened was back in April of this year and there were memorial Facebook pages showing up all over the place. His reps soon debunked the rumors and let the world know that Culkin was alive and well.

Sources confirm the actor is in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.

Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

“The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.”

“It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”

Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Bale, who can next be seen in Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” is still negotiating for the Travis McGee pic “The Deep Blue Goodbye” at Fox. Sources tell Variety talks have taken longer then expected because Bale was not interested in doing a sequel to “Deep Blue” while Fox wanted one.

Insiders say Bale would likely shoot “Jobs” in the spring and follow it up with ‘The Deep Blue Goodbye.”

2344,"North Korea may have a woman at the helm–Kim Jong-Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong–according to a rash of rumors that have popped up recently.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

In this Wednesday, July 25, 2012 photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, right, waves to the crowd as they inspect the Rungna People’s Pleasure Ground in Pyongyang. (AP Photo/Korean Central News Agency via Korea News Service)

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

2345,"Video messaging firm confirmed today the tape where shots appear to ring out in the background was filmed at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on August 9

The individual who made the recording has remained anonymous but handed tape over to the FBI

Multiple shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire with a pause in the middle

A video texting service confirmed today that an audio recording - which appears to contain the sound of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson when he killed unarmed Michael Brown - is authentic.

Chaim Haas, head of communications at Glide, verified the tape recorded by an unnamed individual in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9.

An estimated 11 shots are heard to ring out in the background of the recording with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

Glide released a lengthy statement on their website today which said the user had been live video-messaging with a friend when the gunshots that killed Michael Brown were caught in the background audio.

Glide, an app which provides a real-time video texting service, said on Thursday that the audiotape was genuine and that it was now in the hands of the FBI

The statement continued: 'Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on Saturday, August 9th.'

Officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown on August 9. On a new audio at least ten shots can be heard

Glide confirmed to MailOnline today that the FBI had been in touch with them regarding the audio recording.

The start-up business also said in the statement that it was proud of their app user for turning over the video message to the FBI investigation.

Experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots crack in the background - seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Ms Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

A police expert also said that the recording could cause problems for Officer Wilson who is on leave from the force while a federal investigation is carried out.

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

If the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9.

The medical examiner of behalf of the Brown family released this autopsy drawing which revealed Brown had been shot six times including once in the head

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling the opening of his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleged that Wilson continued to fire on the 18-year-old.

Photographs surround the casket of Michael Brown before the start of his funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis on Monday. The unarmed teen was killed on August 9

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

But CNN reported last Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Michael Brown's funeral was held on Monday at a St Louis church in front of thousands of mourners.

2349,"The Islamic State executioner known as 'Jihadi John' was today revealed to be a university graduate from London who flew to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list.

Mohammed Emwazi, 27, of Queen’s Park, west London, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East in 2012 and later joined ISIS.

Jihadi John has featured in the horrifying execution videos of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese reporter Kenji Goto.

Unmasked: The ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

Arabic speaker Mr Emwazi, who first moved to Britain aged six, was reported to have been raised in a middle-class family and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south-east London.

But after graduating from university in 2009, he claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by the security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Mr Emwazi alleged an agent from MI5 knew ‘everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with’ and claimed the organisation attempted to ‘turn’ him to work for them.

One of Kuwait-born Mr Emwazi’s close friends identified him, telling a newspaper: ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.’

And Asim Qureshi, research director a British human rights group Cage - who had been in contact with Mr Emwazi before he left for Syria - said he also believed the man was Jihadi John.

Mr Qureshi told the Washington Post: ‘There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.'

Home: Mr Emwazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House (above), which is part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years

According to the newspaper, in May 2009 Mr Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain.

En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab.

The Washington Post reported Mr Emwazi - who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam - then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT, but he was detained by counter-terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London.

They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings, and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait. Mr Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK.

The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages.

Scotland Yard would not confirm the name, and Downing Street declined to comment on the report.

Mr Emazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House, part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years.

A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ‘We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

‘“Jihadi John” is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

‘The fact that “Jihadi John” has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.’

In September, it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS. It was revealed security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions.

Horrifying: Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (pictured)

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends.

Not him: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - a London rapper initially identified as a suspect - was ruled out

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms.

The 23-year-old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head.

Other Britons from Portsmouth, Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John, who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms.

It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention.

There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad.

David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes.

In an interview with MailOnline last month, the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John.

'These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved,' the Prime Minister said. 'And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through.'

Speaking in November, Mr Cameron said: ‘You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria.’

Briton named as Jihadi John claimed he was repeatedly approached by MI5 to become an informant and believed he was being harassed by agents

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria, it was claimed today.

Mr Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa.

The British citizen, who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six, flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari.

But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian's officials.

He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists, Mr Emwazi told a confidant.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post: 'Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated'.

Mr Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co-operate and denied he had any links to terrorism.

Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man 'obsessed' with Somalia and would make them watch Al-Shabaab videos while in captivity.

In June 2010 counter-terrorism officers, linked to the security services and Scotland Yard, allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait. He was fingerprinted and searched, it was said, and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain.

In an email to Mr Qureshi he said: 'I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait'.

Another friend said: ‘He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.’

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving.

He was 'desperate' to leave Britain and 'was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation', Mr Qureshi said.

Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed 'actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions'.

Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria, where he may now be ISIS' figurehead.

The University of Westminster was one of the 21 university institutions which have been found to promote gender segregation.

Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated.

At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’.

The research found that on March 21, 2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs. Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society (WTCA), a Hizb ut-Tahrir front group, and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker.

When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender, the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith-based’, which exempted it from equal opportunities policy.

In addition to this, an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’. It was logged by Student Rights for this reason.

Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend, the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too...the information discussed in the only women talks/or notes can be put to the public after the talk...the topics at hand do not only concern women.’

The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that: ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating, supportive, inclusive and accessible learning and working environment... The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.’"

2356,"Nigeria’s government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago.

Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms.

Part of the deal includes “the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, Chibok”, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president’s national information centre.

There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps.

“From the discussions, [Boko Haram’s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,” Mr Omeri said. “They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl’s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.

Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.

There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.

“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.

“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”

Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.

“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.

“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”

Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.

The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.

Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.

The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.

It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.

Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.

The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.

The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.

Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations."
2360,"Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

If you woke up this morning to a Twitter feed filled with recycled ""OMG BANKSY WAS ARRESTED/WTF BANKSY WAS NOT ARRESTED"" exclamations, here's why.

This week's fickle rumor started with The National Report, which for those unaware, is an American satire site. A satirical post on the site reported, in a joking fashion lost on many an Internet surfer, that a 35-year-old man had been apprehended by authorities in the London suburb of Watford early Monday morning. It claimed that a press conference had validated that the man was indeed Banksy, that the BBC confirmed the information in their report, and that five men in total had been snagged with counterfeit money and ""future projects of vandalism.""

2364,"The US is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed the leader of the Al Shabaab terrorist group.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said drones and manned aircraft bombed a gathering of Al Shabaab commanders in a camp in south-central Somalia on Monday.

""US special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions,"" he said.

Mr Kirby confirmed that the attack was aimed at leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, also referred to as Abu-Zubayr, and that the bombs definitely hit the meeting of Shabaab chiefs.

But he said it was unclear if Godane had been killed in the raid.

""We are still assessing the results of the operation, and we'll provide additional information when and if appropriate,"" he said.

The assault did not involve US ground troops, Mr Kirby added.

He declined to provide details of the special operations forces' unit that took part in the air raid or the nature of the intelligence that led to the strike.

The militant group is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, regularly launching attacks against state targets and in neighbouring countries that contribute to the African Union force.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled Al Shabaab as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The US State Department has listed Godane as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives and, if confirmed, his death would mark a serious setback for Al Shabaab forces.

The bombing raid reflected a commitment by Washington and its allies ""to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as ... threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world,"" Mr Kirby said.

2365,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."

2370,"It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

ANALYSIS | Has 'rock star' Pope Francis really launched a revolution?
However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

Misreading of remarks

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

'There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done.'
- Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini
""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to put the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.

The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

A spokeswoman for the New York Times did not immediately have any comment.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

What does Pope Francis think about pets?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity."""
2371,"Breaking news: The Teletubbies’ solar infant deity is none other than an English 19-year old.
Which 'Oogieloves' star (yes, there are actual stars) should be most embarrassed? 'Teletubbies' recap: Po voted out of the pod!
The folks at the Mirror U.K. report the true identity of the baby as Jess Smith, a dance-education student at Canterbury Christ Church University. (Not that other Jessica Smith from Laguna Beach; this Smith was vehement in that fact.)
“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story,” Smith told the Mirror.
Smith, who was chosen out of a slew of babies thanks to her smiling prowess, provided evidence of her reign in Teletubbyland—including a letter from the production company of Teletubbies, as well as several profile pictures of herself smiling to prove that she still matches the facial features of the queen of the Tubz. Her payment for lording over those four colorful weirdos for years on end? £250 and a box of toys. Really? They couldn’t wrestle some cash out of Tinky Winky’s purse? Okay.

2372,"Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were expected to announce the change Monday, but reaction to the new policy has been mixed ahead of the press conference.

The NYPD’s old strategy for combating pot possession is going up in smoke.

In a historic change, city cops will stop arresting people on low-level marijuana charges and issue tickets instead, various police and other sources said Monday.

Persons caught smoking on the street would still wind up in the pokey, they said. But someone caught with a small amount of reefer would be slapped with a summons.

The new policy is expected to be formally announced later Monday by Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton at an afternoon press conference, but already law enforcement and reformers were weighing in — both for and against the new rule.

“This should free up police manpower to pursue cases of greater magnitude while relieving some of the congestion in the courts,” Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan said in support.

The Drug Policy Alliance said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the new NYPD policy.

“Most of those arrested are young men of color, even though young white men use marijuana at higher rates,” the group said in a statement.

Richard Aborn of the Citizens Crime Commission said the new rule will have the long-lasting effect of making it easier for more young people to find legitimate employment.

“There’s no criminal record,” he said. “You don’t have the stigma of a criminal record.”

“I think it’s sad,” countered Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins. “I think this is the beginning of an avalanche. Basically, what he's doing is equating an illegal substance to a parking ticket.”

Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said they want clarity from the top for their membership.

“Anything less will result in our members being held responsible for a failed policy by a discipline obsessed police department and the multiple levels of police oversight it has,” Lynch said in a statement. “We do not want police officers left holding the bag if crime rises because of poor policy.”

Sam Pirozzolo, vice-president of the NYC Parents Union, said the new NYPD rule “sends a very mixed message to our children.”

“It’s saying that it's OK to smoke marijuana because it's now less of a crime, but overall we know drugs are harmful,"" said Pirozzolo, whose daughter is a ninth-grader at Susan Wagner High School in Staten Island.

As it is, misdemeanor marijuana arrests are down citywide in the first 10 months of the year — about 24,000 compared to 29,000 last year.

There has been a growing pressure on law enforcement to curb arrests for small amounts of pot because they are disproportionately made in black and Hispanic communities.

According to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, blacks and Hispanics represented 86% of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city in the first eight months of the year.

The new NYPD policy was embraced by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson during his 2013 campaign for office. He promised to fine those arrested with small amounts of marijuana rather than put them in cuffs and charge them.

""Too many young people are being arrested for low-level drug charges that leave a permanent stain on their records for what should be a violation,"" Thompson has said.

The de Blasio administration has been slow to embrace that strategy, but Bratton has spoken recently about handling some minor criminal offenses without making arrests.

Bratton and the NYPD’s policy of aggressively targeting low-level crime has come under criticism in the wake of Eric Garner’s death from a police chokehold after he was arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes.

Critics say it’s main flaw is that it pits the police against minorities, who wind up being the chief targets of the strategy.

2374,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the target of a U.S. airstrike Monday in Somalia.

The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, confirmed the death in a brief written statement. President Barack Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, said the successful U.S. strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists.

Obama said the U.S. would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

“We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. “That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” a White House statement said.

“Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military – to address the threat that al-Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people.” It added.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008.

Kirby said on Tuesday, before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died, that the U.S. strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted. He noted that in September 2013, Godone had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

“Under the leadership of Godane, al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings, including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia, as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali,” Kirby said Tuesday."

Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6 million - £4.3million - for her release.

Her death is not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan.

Earlier this week the Kingdom vowed to destroy ISIS and stepped up airstrikes on the group's de facto capital Raqqa after the militants filmed themselves burning Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh to death while he was locked in a cage.

Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6 million for her release

Victim: Kayla Jean Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend

Shocking: American officials said they were looking into the reports if Kayla Jean Mueller's death. The White House said it was looking into the claim but that so far there was no evidence that corroborated it

Mueller allegedly died during an hour-long bombardment on the jihadis north Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to an unverified statement on a website commonly used by the terror group.

In August 2013, U.S. officials and Mueller's family in her hometown of Prescott, Arizona had requested that her name not be published for fear of putting her in further danger.

ISIS had reportedly demanded more than $6 million for her release and is believed to have sent a video of Mueller wearing a burqa and pleading for her life to her aid worker colleagues last August, according to the New York Times

A statement released this afternoon by ISIS sources said: 'The criminal Crusader coalition aircraft bombarded a site outside the city of Raqqa today at noon while the people were performing the Friday prayer.'

'The air assaults were continuous on the same location for more than an hour,' it added before sharing photographs of a bombed out building that it claimed had come under attack.

ISIS then claimed Mueller had been inside the building at the time and had been killed, but added that no militants had been injured.

Reports emerged later today that the date on the photographs of the alleged strikes were one day off.

There were no images of Mueller herself and ISIS' claim could not be independently verified.

Mueller is believed to have been working with Spanish Doctors Without Borders when she and her Syrian boyfriend ventured into the Syrian city of Aleppo in August 2013.

Shortly after arriving the pair are believed to have been kidnapped by Islamic State militants and taken to the terror group's stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa.

Blast: ISIS released images of this badly damaged building in which they claimed Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed during an Jordanian airstrike

Rubble: ISIS Mueller had been inside the building at the time of the airstrike and had been killed. The group added that none of its militants had been injured during the raid

Several images of the damaged building were released by ISIS but there was no proof of Mueller being killed

Islamic State militants have claimed an American aid worker was killed during a Jordanian air strike, it has been reported. Above, a Jordanian Royal Air Force F-16 fighter jet pictured yesterday

American officials said they were urgently looking into the reports of Mueller's death.

Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for President Barack Obama's National Security Council, said the White House has 'not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates' the claim.

'We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,' she added.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters traveling with the president to Indiana on Friday that the U.S. does coordinate with the Jordanian air force on airstrikes.

He wouldn't say whether the U.S. was aware of the hostage's location.

The ISIS statement could not be independently verified but initially appeared on a militant website commonly used by ISIS and was also distributed by ISIS-affiliated Twitter users.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants.

Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after ISIS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot.

The Syrian government said yesterday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa today although unverified reports on social media claimed the city had been hit multiple times.

Miss Mueller had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in her local newspaper. She told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

‘For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,’ she said.

‘It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.’

In a statement today, her family told US radio broadcaster NPR that Miss Mueller had spent her adult life 'travelling the world and helping those in need.'

They said: 'After graduating from college, she spent more than one year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine.

'She returned home to Arizona in 2011, and worked for one year at an HIV/AIDS clinic while volunteering at a women's shelter at night.

Brutal: Kayla Jean Mueller's death is not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan. Earlier this week the Kingdom vowed to destroy ISIS after Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh was filmed being burnt to to death while he was locked in a cage (pictured)

'In December 2011, she traveled to France to be an au pair so she could learn French in preparation for work in Africa.

'War sidetracked Kayla's Africa plans as she was drawn to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees.

'She moved to the Turkish/Syrian border in December 2012 and began working with the organizations Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to assist families who had been forced to flee their homes.

'Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she was extremely devoted to the people of Syria.'

Miss Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend.

All of the other aid workers are believed to have subsequently been released by the terror group.

Mueller is from a small town in Arizona where her father runs an auto body repair shop.

Her parents, both in their early 60s, have a large detached home on the side of a hill in a rural area of the state.

The university graduate was a determined activist as a young woman who volunteered for three years with a coalition battling genocide in war torn African nations.

The young humanitarian conducted two silent walks in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issue.

She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in US policy.

Her efforts landed her with several youth awards and she went on to dedicate her life to humanitarian aid.

If Kayla Jean Mueller was killed by ISIS, she would be the latest in a string of victims killed while being held hostage by the terror group.

The group also holds British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in other extremist propaganda videos.

James Foley

US journalist James Foley, who was taken hostage at gunpoint in northern Syria in November 2012, was the first Islamic State prisoner to be beheaded on film – killed by the man now known to be Jihadi John.

ISIS posted the graphic video of his death, shot in an unknown location, on social media last August as proof of their barbaric actions. It would be the first of a number of similarly brutal videos.

If Mueller's death is confirmed, then he will join a list of other victims, including Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) were murdered by the terror group

Steven Sotloff

Two weeks later ISIS released a video that shows the beheading of a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff.

In the clip the group said his murder was in retaliation for the Obama administration’s continued airstrikes in Iraq.

Mr Sotloff, 31, from Miami, freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines. He vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in the video of Mr Foley’s beheading.

The executioner, who appeared to be the same man who killed Foley, threatened to kill a Briton who was being held hostage by the group next.

David Haines

On September 13, just two weeks after the previous video, ISIS released a clip that showed the beheading of David Haines. This time the message was directed at Prime Minister David Cameron.

The British father-of-two had spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians across the Third World.

US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre). Aid worker Peter Kassig (right) is also dead

Alan Henning

Just weeks later the group released footage of the beheading of 47-year-old aid worker Alan Henning.

The father of two, who had been in Syria providing aid to refugees when he was taken hostage, was murdered by the masked British militant known as Jihadi John in a video posted online.

Peter Kassig

On November 16 US aid worker Peter Kassig and 18 Syrian soldiers were beheaded in a video released by ISIS.

Kenhi Goto and Haruna Yukawa

In January this year, ISIS demanded ransom for two Japanese hostages – Kenhi Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Just four days later, Goto appeared in a video, holding a photo of beheaded hostage Yukawa. IS demanded the release of terror suspect Sajida al-Rishawi, in exchange for Goto.

Last Saturday, a video showing the decapitated body of Goto was released by the group.

The group released a video showing the decapitated body Kenhi Goto (left) last week. On Tuesday, Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (right) was filmed as he was burnt alive while trapped in a cage

Moaz al-Kasasbeh

On Tuesday, ISIS released a video that showed captured Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burnt alive while locked in a cage.

The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is seen being set alight.

Within an hour of the 22-minute-long video's publication, Jordan had reportedly moved ISIS-linked prisoners to a jail in the south of the country which is usually used for state executions.

Two, including would-be female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, were executed at dawn."
2377,"Does Russia have better smartphones or are Russians just better photographers under pressure – like when a Yeti walks directly in front of them?
Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

Location of Adygeysk
The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual. However, some video viewers say the Yeti walks too much like a human to be real. Others point out that this is a tourist area and any Bigfoot sighting is sure to increase the number of visitors (and possibly raise property values).

2379,"What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago?

This week, Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story. An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F-250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet. 

A representative of Mr. Oberholtzer’s company, Mark-1 Plumbing Company, tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year. 

Were members of the Ansar al-Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks? Or was there a more indirect path?

Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many, many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East.

But Andrew Collins, who oversees Jalopnik.com’s “Truck Yeah!” vertical, says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think.

“If he traded it in, he would have no idea where it’s going,” Mr. Collins says. “The highest bidder takes it, and they can do whatever they want.”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days. 

Car auctions, held several times each week, attract both used car dealers and exporters, he says.

Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that, generally, are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy, Collins says, who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor.

Exporters then ship the cars overseas, where they are fixed up and resold.

“The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants,” says Collins, who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year. “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them. But [exporters] could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it. It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller, but I don’t think it had to be that complex.”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News.

Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck.

Oberholtzer’s son, Jeff, tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country.

Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Fox News’ Greta van Susteren Tuesday that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” saying he received the information from a border patrol source.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been rebutting similar claims for weeks, that’s bogus.

RELATED: Geraldo to Fox & Friends: Don’t Mix Up War on Terror with Immigration Debate

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

One of Hunter’s sources modified the claim after the congressman’s comments, saying that those apprehended might be ISIS-affiliated or even American who fought with the Syrian Free Army, one of ISIS’ many enemies.

Hunter didn’t back down. “The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” a spokesperson told ABC News. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

2386,"In a horrifying act of revenge for U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq, militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage, U.S. officials say.

The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American.

It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria, where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower.

Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley's killing.

U.S. officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley. Separately, Foley's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release, saying they ""have never been prouder of him.""

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" said the statement, which was attributed to Foley's mother, Diane Foley. She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages. ""Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.""

Foley, 40, from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011, upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war. The killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.

The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group's media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes.

It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. After the captive speaks, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck; the video fades to black before the beheading is completed. The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

At the end of the video, a militant shows a second man, who was identified as another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and warns that he could be the next captive killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013; he had freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.

One U.S. official said the video appeared to be authentic, and two other U.S. officials said the victim was Foley. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it's likely that some were.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida's leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report in November, the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group's report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives' release.

The statement, which circulated on Twitter, said an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria killed the 26-year-old Mueller. The statement used Mueller’s full name, which had not been public.

The claim could not be immediately confirmed and ISIS did not provide photographic evidence of Mueller’s death, as the group has in the past with other hostages and its own fighters.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they have “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim,” using an alternate acronym for the terror group.

A Jordanian official told ABC News ISIS's claim was ""illogical"" and was part of the terror group's public relations campaign. ""We need to be very careful not to fall in their trap,"" the official said.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, called ISIS's claim ""an old and sick trick.""

""So they behead innocent #US #UK & Japan hostages & BURN a brave #jordan pilot ALIVE & now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!"" Judeh said on Twitter, referring to previous atrocities apparently committed on camera by ISIS fighters.

The ISIS statement appeared to contain some discrepancies, including Thursday’s date on accompanying pictures purportedly showing the building that was struck, while the statement claimed the strikes occurred during Friday prayers. ISIS also claimed Mueller was the only person killed in that particular airstrike, with none of its fighters injured or killed.

Officials believe ISIS has misled the public before about the fate of hostages. The Jordanian government said ISIS killed a Jordanian pilot the terror group was holding a month ago, even though the terror group pretended he was alive during hostages negotiations last week.

Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and “has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,” the family spokesperson said.

Mueller told her town's local newspaper, The Daily Courier, she felt called to help those suffering the most in the midst of the Syrian conflict.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said in the May 2013 report. “[I will not let this be] something we just accept… It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

In October 2011, Mueller uploaded a video to a Syrian activist YouTube channel in which she said, “I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.”"

A video posted online Tuesday purportedly shows an Islamist extremist beheading James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria more than 18 months ago.

A graphic video of the purported killing, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, was posted online Tuesday and quickly spread on social media. The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday saying it couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video or Foley’s fate.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the post read. “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said the American intelligence community “is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.”

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said. “We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” near the Turkish border, the FBI said in an alert following the Nov. 22, 2012, kidnapping. He was in Binesh covering the Syrian civil war for the GlobalPost website and AFP.

2389,"Small-time drug offenders in New York City could soon find themselves on the receiving end of a ticket instead of inside a jail cell if a policy change on low-level marijuana possession is adopted this week. The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents, who represented 86 percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.

Advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on one’s record, but there is a chance that the policy, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce Monday, could boomerang. The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana – likely to be defined as 25 grams or less – to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed, arrested and fingerprinted. But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review, which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place, legal experts say.

Under the current system, when an arrest is made, the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor. A prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process, such as searching a person’s backpack without probable cause. Prosecutorial reviews “perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases,” Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, told International Business Times. Under the new policy, “that function has now been eclipsed,” he said.

That sentiment was echoed by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson, who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations. The Brooklyn DA’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of 2,526 such cases since July, according to the New York Times. Allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates “a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place,” Thompson told the Times. “These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”

Another possible repercussion of the city’s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates, adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket. Some 28,000 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in 2013; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or cannot miss work on the day of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system. “It’s not solving the problem that they’re trying to solve,” Fagan said.

As many states, counties and cities across the country have done at various times over the past several decades, New York decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 1977. The law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked. Nevertheless, police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings. ""At this point, [not arresting people for weed] wouldn't be progressive; it'd be catching up with the mainstream,"" Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told Vice."

The two-minute long footage was allegedly filmed in the outskirts of the Syrian Kurdish-majority town, which has been besieged by jihadists after a fierce military assault.

In the clip, armed Isis fighters show several boxes containing weapons, munitions and grenades that were allegedly airdropped by US C-130 cargo planes and were from the Iraqi Kurdistan government. German-manufactured grenades can be also seen in the video, which was published by pro-Isis Amaq News agency.

On Sunday, the US military said it had air dropped weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Kurdish forces defending Kobani. In a statement, the US central command said US C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and supplies that were provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq, in order to allow Kurdish forces to resist Isis assault and take full control of Kobani.

According to Lahur Jangi Talabani, the director of the intelligence agency of the Kurdistan government, 24 tons of small arms and ammunition and 10 tons of medical supplies were delivered to Kurdish forces in three US planes.

2398,"His voice served as a call to action, an echo that continues today whenever a kid bellows the word “hip hop” into a microphone. It was in Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson’s lyrical wobble, the way he rapped through the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the singular hit that propelled a movement when it was released in 1979.

Jackson, 57, died Tuesday morning after complications from cancer, but his influence remains.

The news was confirmed by David Mallie, the business manager for the two surviving members of the original Sugarhill Gang, Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien and “Wonder Mike” Wright.

Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.
-  
“They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece,” rapped Big Bank Hank on “Rapper’s Delight,” a boast that codified one of rap’s central themes -- self-aggrandizement. Little did he know at the time how accurate he was, and that through said devastation Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

2399,"Once again rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro have spread across the exile community and across social media.

El Diario de las Américas, a Florida-based publication read mostly by Cuban exiles, reported Thursday that the Cuban government had called a press conference amid speculation about Castro’s health. The Cuban government later disputed the report, saying no such press event had been planned, according to AFP’s correspondent in Havana.

The Cuban government’s lack of transparency and the lack of an independent mass media on the island have long provided fertile ground for rumor’s of 88-year-old Castro’s death since he fell ill in 2006.

Since the reports on Thursday Twitter has been abuzz with rumors of his death, though they have not yet been confirmed.

Twitter is saying #FidelCastro is dead. Twitter says people are dead all the time though. Let me not get my hopes up. #CubanAmerican

As Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos warned, this is not the first time Fidel Castro’s alleged death has taken over the internet. In 2012 rumors of his death began circulating after news that Venezuelan doctor, Jose Rafael Marquina, said the former leader had suffered cardiac arrest and was in a vegetative state.

“Careful. Remember that here in Miami, almost like a ritual, Fidel Castro is killed several times a year” Ramos wrote on Twitter.

Thursday marked one year since Castro’s last public appearance, according to Fox News Latino. His absence at major events like the 56th anniversary this week of Castro’s entry into Havana after the victory of the Cuban Revolution or the return last month of three Cubans convicted of spying in the U.S. have led some to believe that his health has worsened. Castro has yet to comment on the historic resumption of diplomatic relations with the United States for the first time since 1961, announced by both governments last month. The most recent ""Reflection,"" as Fidel Castro's columns are called, appeared in October 2014.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was the last head of state to meet with Castro in August 2014 and published photos of their meeting. Maduro stated that he found Castro had an “impressive lucidity, an impressive train of thought and exceptional wisdom.”

Adding to the confusion, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga’s son, Fidel Castro Odinga, was found dead in his home in Nairobi on Jan. 4.

The girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram — the group's nickname means ""education is sinful"" — on April 15 while in school in the northeastern town of Chibok.

2405,"A man says Comcast contacted his employer and got him fired after he called to complain about the company's service.

The Consumerist reports that a man known as Conal complained to Comcast after he was billed for services he didn't actually have. After Conal's complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn't need.

Conal complained to Comcast again after he was billed $1,820 for the surplus hardware. This is where things get interesting. Conal, who says he works for a large American accountancy firm, compiled a spreadsheet showing every erroneous charge he had received from Comcast, which he sent to the company.

Comcast then apparently refused to reverse the error, so in February 2014, Conal decided to try something else. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast's comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts. He said he repeatedly called them about his bill, telling them that Comcast should be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

The Consumerist says that after this, Comcast got in touch with Conal's employer.

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

Business Insider reached out to Comcast for comment on this story, and we will update this article when we hear back.

After Conal's termination, his employer, the accounting company, said it had received an email from Comcast summarizing their conversations.

It's alleged that Conal used the name of his employer during his calls with Comcast, a claim Conal denies. Instead, he says, someone working for Comcast researched him and discovered where he works. To make matters even more complicated, it's reported that the company Conal works for provides consulting services to Comcast.

The ""lousy customer service from Comcast"" story is becoming something of a media meme. Previously, one customer showed in a video that Comcast put him on hold when he called to try to cancel his account, leaving him on hold for so long that the company's office closed for the day. Ryan Block's audio recording of a Comcast rep refusing to close his account is infamous. And earlier this year it was discovered that the only surefire way to get a refund from Comcast is to record your customer service call yourself.

2406,"Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Could ISIS fighters be training as warplane pilots capable of turning their weapons on coalition aircraft?

That's the worrying prospect suggested by an unverified report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that ISIS has three warplanes in its possession in northern Syria.

The Syrian opposition group also claims, citing reliable sources in Syria, that former Iraqi military officers are training members of the Sunni extremist militant group to fly them.

The planes are at the Al-Jarrah military airport east of the contested city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The former Iraqi military officers are among those who have joined ISIS, and people living near the airport have said that they recently saw an airplane flying at low altitude after it took off, according to the Observatory.

Information on how the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State and is also known as ISIL, obtained the planes, or the trainees' previous level of familiarity with flight, wasn't immediately available.

CNN has not independently verified the report.

However, the U.S. Central Command sought to pour cold water on the report.

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" said spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder.

""We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of western and northern Iraq, for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.

Kobani airstrikes target ISIS

This week has seen an increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Aleppo.

The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there.

The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani.

""What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN Friday that Kobani is not tactically or militarily very important -- but has taken on a certain significance.

""It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. ""However, it has attracted the attention of the world.

""The world is watching the coalition fight ISIS and, because of that, a victory by either side in Kobani will have a psychological and strategic communication victory that far outweighs the tactical military victory to whichever side wins.""

In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, on the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands.

Anbar advances

Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday.

ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thursday.

Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town.

The deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi, told CNN by phone Friday that a curfew has been imposed on the city of Ramadi until further notice.

This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. The curfew was imposed Thursday night.

Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with ""heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another.""

Car bomb attacks claimed by ISIS targeted Shia areas of Baghdad Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more.

2407,"Published claims that a NYC high school student made a fortune trading securities turn out to be exaggerated.

Well, here’s a creative way to make your college application stand out: Mohammed Islam, a senior at New York City’s Stuyvesant High School, has become a local celebrity with the publication of a profile in New York magazine that claims he’s made $72 million by trading stocks and other securities in between classes, homework, and extracurricular activities.

Islam, who also appeared on Business Insider‘s 20 under 20 list last year, says he has been trading stocks since he was 9, having been taught by an older cousin who now works at Goldman Sachs. Though he started off trading penny stocks, Islam says he’s made millions since then by betting on gold and crude oil futures, as well as small- and mid-cap stocks.

Depending on your perspective, this story could be read as an inspiring tale about the child of Bengali immigrants beating the odds. Or as a worrisome example of how Wolf of Wall Street-worship — along with a taste for bottle service, models, and BMWs — is corrupting our youth.

If the story is actually true — Islam told New York that his net worth is in the “high eight figures,” but it’s not clear where the $72 million figure came from and no documentation of his profits has yet appeared — it would be interesting to know a little something about his trading strategy. We’ll update if and when we hear from him; so far, Islam has not yet responded to our messages sent via Facebook.

Update: Islam has now told CNBC’s Scott Wapner that he didn’t actually make $72 million trading; that he doesn’t know where the figure came from; that he in fact has made “a few million dollars” trading; and that he is uncomfortable with the way he was portrayed in New York. “The attention is not what we expected,” he told Wapner. “We never wanted the hype.”"

BEIRUT (Reuters) – Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

“They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,” Abdulrahman said.

“People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,” he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING “CLOSE EYE”

“We’re not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,” U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

“We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.”

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

“We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,” he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

A U.S. official confirmed the details of the report to NBC News.

Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, overpowered a guard a Secret Service agent at the front door on Sept. 19, and made it all the way to the East Room of the White House, according to the report. Officials had previously said that Gonzalez only made it just inside the North Portico doors before he was tackled.

The security breach has prompted questions about how the Secret Service allowed Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife and had a hatchet and ammunition in his car, to make it as far inside the building as he did.

The report said an alarm box near the entrance had been muted at the request of White House building staff, and that the guard at the entrance wasn’t notified that an intruder was on the grounds as soon as she could have been.

Twenty years ago, opening statements in the OJ Simpson trial were being heard, a company called AOL rolled out Internet service, and two Aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local McD's. Two of those three things changed dramatically; one didn't, and in another 20 years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled, uber-preserved glory.

According to 9News.com out of Australia, friends Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, only 13 and 14 years old at the time, bought some burgers at an Adelaide McDonald's two decades ago. They ate their burgers, but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten.

No worries -- the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city. Either the friend never returned, or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke; either way, the teens turned into adults, but the burger refused to age.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Dean said. ""It started off as a joke, you know. We told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up, and before we knew it six months had passed.""

Those months turned into years and now, 20 years later, the burger ""looks the same as the day we bought it, perfectly preserved it its original packaging,"" Dean said.

The pair were featured on Australia's Channel 10 news, threatening to finally take a nosh. Even though it was for charity, the trustees of the burger just couldn't bring themselves to bite into it. Can you blame them? All of which begs the question: Exactly what is in a McDonald's burger that keeps it looking the same, 20 year later?"

The story originates from DailyBuzzLive, a fake news site that admits it occasionally publishes ""works of complete fiction,"" and it's being widely shared because it includes a tweet from NASA that boosts its apparent credibility.

But NASA denies both the tweet and the bogus claim that a planetary alignment will somehow let you float for 3 seconds at a time:

""These rumors are false and the image of a NASA tweet circulating is a doctored image,"" the agency said in a statement to AL.com, ""Microgravity exists only off Earth. The crews aboard the International Space Station live and work in microgravity, where they conduct science experiments that take advantage of this unique environment aboard the orbiting laboratory. Temporary microgravity can be created using aircraft flying in parabolic arcs.""

Bad Astronomer Phil Plait also took down the hoax in his Slate column, pointing out that he had to debunk the exact same rumor last year, after it was passed around by a different fake news site. Not only that, but it's actually based on a hoax that's been around for 40 years.

Patrick Moore, cited in DailyBuzzLive's article, was actually a notable British astronomer, and he did actually make the Zero G Day claim in 1976. What the piece leaves out is that it was an April Fools' Day joke.

For the record, Pluto and Jupiter aren't aligning on January 4th, and it wouldn't matter if they did, because they're much, much too far away to exert the kind of gravitational force the fake article describes.

Here's Plait:

In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell ... so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.

Via Yahoo News, she explains:

'I hadn't planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn't want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

The KFC, which is 24 hours, said at first they didn't really notice the poor mourning girl because of the shift changes. Tan Shen decided it was time to return to her parents' home after local media started showing up a week into her Kentucky fried experiment, adding that she was ""getting sick of the taste of chicken.""

The staff at KFC said she'd be missed, so someone out there loves you, girl.

2415,"A schoolboy almost killed by an electric shock from a street lamp now claims he has ‘magnetic superpowers’ like Magneto from X-Men.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, had been walking home after school when he lent briefly against the lamppost that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

He says that since the accident he has been able to attract metal objects like coins and spoons towards his body, just like the famous Marvel villain.

Nikolai said: 'When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.'

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.’

Nikolai says he has now decided to become a superhero rather than a fireman when he is older, as he wants to do something that helps people (clearly fireman wasn’t helping people enough).

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets,' many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin."
2417,"So it wasn’t just “discomfort” that’s been troubling North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un? Kim is being treated in a hospital because he has become so fat that his ankles fractured under his own weight, according to a report in The Telegraph that was attributed to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. The portly 31-year-old absolute ruler had to undergo an operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a grueling round of official engagements, the report said. Kim, who is about 5-foot-9, is believed to have ballooned to more than 280 pounds, apparently due to an unhealthy diet that’s said to include imported Swiss cheese and heavy drinking. Bodyguards are said to have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he’s being treated. Just a few days ago North Korea admitted Kim was suffering from “discomfort” amid speculation that he had gout."
2418,"North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be opening a restaurant in Scotland and serving national favorites such as dog on the menu, experts said.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts,"" Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told the Edinburgh Evening News.

""Despite voting 'No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The report comes just months after Scots voted to remain part of the U.K. in an independence referendum. North Korea backed the calls for Scottish Independence, and the historic moment could be behind the controversial leader's potential move to locate his next ""Pyongyang"" restaurant branch in Scotland.

The North Korean embassy in London declined to comment. The Scottish government said it was looking into the report.

The regime – which has been accused of severe human rights abuses by the United Nations – opened the first branches of Pyongyang near the border with China in the 1990s. Kim Jong Un's restaurant expansion plans saw a branch open in Amsterdam in 2012. This eventually closed down but reopened under the name of Haedanghwa.

Pyongyang restaurants are known for being a lavish and expensive experience. Traditional Korean music and entertainment often takes place. Jim Hoare, a Korea expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, has visited the restaurants in Asia. He said the main aim of them is to raise money and up the profile of the regime abroad.

North Korea has been seen as notoriously closed to the outside world and its reputation took at further battering at the end of last year when U.S. officials blamed Kim Jong Un's regime for the unprecedented hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The move into Scotland could be to drum up support for North Korea, but despite Kim Jong Un's love of cheese and whisky, Hoare was surprised by the choice of location.

""Scottish food is very conservative and the idea of them taking to Korean food…I can't think it is the obvious place to go,"" Hoard said.

""This type of restaurant is not aimed at the Korean community but aimed at rich foreigners who might want to spend money, and may be more suited to London."""
2419,"Along with unveiling the Apple Watch earlier this year, the company also announced that the prices for the wearable device will start at $349. French website iGen.fr now claims to have an idea about the pricing of the stainless steel variant, as well as the gold variant.

According to the publication, the stainless steel variant of the Apple Watch will be priced around $500, while the gold variant will be priced between $4,000 to $5,000. This is in line with earlier rumors, which claimed that the top-end variant of the Apple Watch will be priced above $1,000. While Apple didn’t announce which variant would be priced $350, it is widely believed to be the entry-level aluminum variant of the Apple Watch.

RELATED: All you want to know: Apple Watch specifications, features and price

As for the availability, the publication claims that the first Apple Watch will start shipping by Valentine’s Day 2015. While this is in line with earlier rumors, it is in contrast with what Apple Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts hinted yesterday. In a video message to the company’s retail employees, she hinted that the Apple Watch will launch in spring next year. She said, “We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.”"
2420,"An app manipulation farm sounds like someplace developers would go for a weekend retreat, complete with chiropractor sessions. In fact — according to a photo which has gone viral on social media in China — it’s a place where devs can pay for their apps’ download numbers to be artificially inflated.

Why would anyone want to do this? Simply put: because more downloads (perhaps accompanied by positive reviews) enhances apps’ chart position, thereby raising their discoverability level, and hopefully prompting people to download them.

The photo in question appears to show a worker at one such place, sitting in front of what look like around 100 iPhone 5c units. Reports claim that her job is download, install, and uninstall specific apps repeatedly to boost their App Store rankings. Another similar table can be seen opposite her.

The image is accompanied by a second one, showing the alleged prices being charged to get your app to the top of the App Store rankings. Here’s how much you need to pay to secure a no. 1 rated app for yourself:

The alleged price sheet claims that a person looking to get into the top 10 free apps list is looking at spending $11,200. To stay there, they will then need to shell out $65,000 per week.

By searching for “app store ranking manipulation” using China’s most popular C2C e-commerce site, Taobao, numerous similar services can be found. As much as Apple frowns on manipulation of the App Store rankings, for local entrepreneurs a scheme like this is a certified cash cow — even with the large number of handsets and employees you need to spend money on."
2421,"Apple has been evaluating platinum for future versions of the Apple Watch, and may be using ceramic blending to achieve the extra-durable gold in first-generation Edition units, according to a new report.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Apple has been studying platinum casings, but that even if the company intends to build them, they are not expected to be announced during today's press event in San Francisco. Platinum watches can often sell for triple the price of gold ones.

The gold in the Edition Apple Watches is already anticipated to make them some of the most expensive products Apple has ever sold. Rumors have put prices anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000; for that reason, Apple is also allegedly installing special safes in its stores. The cheapest Watch will be $349, and midrange models could start around $500 or $600.

Apple may not be using standard 18-karat gold. Company exectutives have repeatedly claimed that their material is ""twice as hard"" as regular gold — which is fairly malleable — but haven't explained how this possible. Leancrew points to an Apple patent application describing an infusion of low-density ceramic particles.

By weight, 18-karat gold is actually just 75 percent gold, with the remaining quarter normally being silver, copper, or a combination of metals. The Apple alloy could use less than a third of the gold traditionally required while still meeting 18-karat standards.

AppleInsider will be providing live coverage of today's press event, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, and can be viewed at live.appleinsider.com. The Apple Watch is expected to occupy the most stage time."
2423,"It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.

There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine.

One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.

Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.

Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.

2431,"The Apple Watch is on track for a February release, according to supply chain sources in China. A February launch echoes an earlier report from The Information, which said Apple will be “lucky” to ship by Valentine’s Day.

While mass manufacturing of the Apple Watch hasn’t begun yet, there are already concerns that sapphire production won’t be able to meet initial demand. The constraints will likely result in making more expensive Apple Watch models harder to come by.

All sapphire for the Apple Watch is coming from Apple’s plant with GT Advanced (GTAT) in Arizona. Because of Apple’s very stringent quality specifications, GTAT will reportedly be unable to meet the level of output Apple had hoped.

Not all Apple Watch models use a sapphire display, however. The lowest-end Apple Watch Sport uses strengthened Ion-X glass, while the mid-level Apple Watch and higher-end gold Apple Watch Edition use sapphire.

Initial supply constraints are not uncommon for Apple products, especially entirely new product categories like the Watch. If lines to see the Watch in person during Paris Fashion Week are any indication, demand will be extremely high when it goes on sale.

Since the Apple Watch was unveiled last month, it’s been clear that the product is unfinished on multiple levels. Demo units shown to the press have been running videos on continuous loops, and Apple hasn’t said anything about pricing. All Apple has said about availability is that it plans to ship by “early 2015.”

2432,"A California company is hoping to revolutionize the security business with autonomous robots.

The Knightscope K5 is one of four drones now patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus.

Matt Stambaugh, the Calgary Eyeopener's science and technology columnist, spoke about how the five feet tall robots learn.

""You take them to an area, apparently an operator has to walk around the perimeter where they're supposed to patrol once, then they go about learning their environments,"" said Stambaugh. ""What they're using is a variety of different sensors essentially to take the role of what a lot of private security contractors do today.""

According to Stambaugh, the robots are capable of detecting anomalies and making decisions.

""It's not quite as advanced as what Google is doing with their self-driving car, but they've got different sensors on board to make a map of the area and then they've got code on board to decide what is something that should be reported back.""

""They've got thermal imaging if you need. They've got chemical sensors, licence plate recognition software [and] facial recognition software,"" said Stambaugh. ""It looks kind of like a large Roomba. And so instead of looking for dust bunnies it's looking for, you know, criminals.""

K5s to hit the market in 2015

According to Stambaugh, the robots will be hitting the market starting 2015.

""What the company Knightscope is trying to do is to lease these out on a per-hour basis,"" said Stambaugh. ""So $6.25 an hour they'll lease you one of these K5s and that's about half the price of the average security guard.""

There are many advantages to a robot over a human patrol. 

""They'll work triple shift, 24 hours a day. The battery is supposed to last around a day and when it runs out they go back to a charging carpet and in 20 minutes they are charged up again.""

Stambaugh also said the robots do not have any weapons, but that may change in the future.

""Basically what it's doing is calling back to a manned response centre if something is going wrong,"" he said."
2433,"Jordan’s King Abdullah is reportedly personally involved in executing air strikes against Islamic State positions in the aftermath of the terrorist group’s brutal execution of Jordanian pilot 1st Lt. Moaz Kasasbeh.

Shafaqna news and Iraqinews.com claimed to have confirmed with their sources that King Abdullah is personally involved in conducting the air strikes. What remains unclear is whether Abdullah is personally suiting up and flying a plane, or instead commanding units involved in the mission.

“The Jordanian King Abdullah II will participate personally on Thursday in conducting air strikes against the shelters of the terrorist ISIL organization to revenge the execution of the Jordanian pilot [Kasasbeh] by the ISIL,” said the IraqiNews report.

Others on social media have reported similar statements.

Jordanian Author Waleed Abu Nada Tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, “Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow.”

Middle East commentator Joseph Braude wrote on Twitter: “Reports that Jordanian King Abdullah, himself a pilot, will fly sorties on ISIS targets.”

Before assuming the throne, Abullah II was a Major General in charge of Jordanian Special Forces. Abdullah is also certified as a Cobra Attack Helicopter Pilot. In 1980, he joined the UK’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. in the British Army.

Jordanian air strikes on Wednesday neutralized at least 55 Islamic State jihadists, including a top Islamic State commander who was known as the “Prince of Nineveh,” according to reports."
2434,"Two of the nation’s leading experts on the use of deadly force by the police are warning against overreaction to an audio recording that purportedly captures the sound of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown.

The newly surfaced recording, which has not been publicly verified by investigators, was first broadcast by CNN.

On the 12-second clip, it is possible to hear a series of what appears to be quick pops, followed by a brief pause and then another succession of rapid shots. St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal and her client, who wishes to remain anonymous to the public, took the recording to the FBI on Monday. Blumenthal says she counted 11 shots fired.

“There's that pause, which is what gave me pause, when I first saw it,” Blumenthal told Yahoo News. “It was a pause so there was time to think about it and deliberate. That doesn't mean that I'm saying it helps one side or the other. But I do know that in a 12-second tape, where eight seconds of it is a shooting, a three-second delay is a significant period of time.”

Ron Martinelli and Michael Levine, both longtime criminal justice consultants, told Yahoo News that the audio needs to be authenticated and considered with other evidence before its importance can be evaluated.

“Pauses may or may not be anything of tremendous significance,” said Martinelli, a retired officer and criminologist specializing in police practices. “The answer is: It depends. In the end, this is about a forensic reconciliation of statements and forensic facts and evidence.”

Levine, a retired DEA agent and law enforcement trainer, said that anyone willing to put a value on a recording before it has been corroborated is discrediting themselves.

“If they gave that opinion on a witness stand, they would be chewed up and spit out by any defense attorney, even a defense attorney that got his degree at Sears & Roebuck School of Law,” Levine said.

Blumenthal told Yahoo News that she has no qualms about bringing the recording forward.

“There's no bad evidence, there's just evidence,” Blumenthal said. “It doesn't take sides. It helps lead to where you are going and discover the truth. Every little bit helps.”

The potential new discovery comes to light more than two weeks after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, in broad daylight in the middle of a residential street.

The audio was unwittingly captured by a man taping  an online web chat inside his apartment near the shooting scene.

On the recording, the unidentified Ferguson resident is heard complimenting a friend’s looks during a video chat, when two bursts of loud pops erupt in the background.

Blumenthal said her client heard the noise, but paid it no attention because gunshots are common in the neighborhood. The unidenitifed man, she said, had to be persuaded to come forward.

“Even after I talked to them about it, they were very dubious that it had any type of value,” Blumenthal said. “My client nor I are seeking any publicity or attention at all. There's no motivation to say it is what it's not.""

Blumenthal said she and her client were interviewed by FBI agents about the recording late Monday.

Federal and state investigators are conducting separate criminal and civil rights investigations into the controversial shooting.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said Wilson was attempting to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the road, when the officer realized that the pair fit the description of suspects being sought in the theft of cigars from a nearby convenience store.

Chief Jackson said a scuffle ensued after the teen struck Wilson in the face and that a shot was fired inside the officer’s squad car as Brown attempted to grab the officer’s gun. But Johnson has told reporters that it was Wilson who was the aggressor, and that Brown never went for the weapon. Instead, Johnson says, the officer shot his friend while Brown was trying to flee but had stopped and put his hands up in surrender.

Wilson, 28, is on paid leave and has not spoken publicly about the shooting.

Blumenthal said her client gave a copy of the recording to federal investigators.

“(The FBI) thought this would be an important piece of the investigation,” she told CNN.

An FBI spokesperson declined to address the issue of the recording when contacted by Yahoo News on Tuesday.

FBI audio engineers are reportedly planning to analyze the recording for authenticity.

Mark O’Mara, the Florida attorney who successfully defended shooting suspect George Zimmerman, told CNN that while it may be too early judge the audio’s significance, the scientific review could unearth new evidence.

“I look forward to hearing if that tape has Mike Brown’s or Darren Wilson’s voice on it saying stop,” O’Mara said.

Separate autopsies performed on Brown revealed that he was struck at least six times, including by what was likely a fatal shot to the top of his head. Authorities have not disclosed how many times Wilson fired his weapon.
Veteran forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg listened to the recording on Tuesday.

“The gunshots are unmistakable,"" Ginsberg told Yahoo News.

By Ginsberg’s count, he said, there are 10 shots on the recording, but he said he could understand why an untrained ear might hear more.

“I can confidently say that I heard at least 10 shots,” said Ginsberg, who has worked on such major investigations as the Sandy Hook school shooting. “I'm hearing six shots, followed by very close to three seconds of pause, followed by four more shots.”

Messages sent to Ferguson police seeking information on the type of service weapon that it assigns to officers went unanswered on Tuesday. Levine said officers across the country commonly carry semi-automatic pistols with a capacity of 15 to 17 bullets.

Any potential pause in Wilson’s shooting would have to be weighed against statements given to investigators, Levine said.

Levine said the pause “would raise an alarm if I had qualified witness statements and the officer’s statement that conflicts with that.” He added, “But I don’t know what this officer’s official statement is here. I don’t think anyone does.”

2438,"Innovative might not be the first word that comes to mind in describing Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due? Let's face it, after that harrowing 18-minute customer service call went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for—it had reached peak horrible. Yet if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer's employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.

The full story in all its sadistic glory is at Consumerist, but here's the SparkNotes version. A customer named ""Conal"" started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren't applied. Conal considered canceling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he'd never ordered.

This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast's billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal's employer—a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.

It's hard to know who's telling the truth here. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That's a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company's name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring ""for quality assurance purposes."" If you want it done right, record the call yourself."

Assistant executive engineer A.K Verma went on leave in 1990 after joining India’s central public works department (CPWD) a decade earlier.

Verma defied bosses’ orders to return to work after his requests for additional leave were denied.

“He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of “wilful absence from duty” in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu ordered his dismissal in order to “streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability,” it said.

India’s civil servants have long been notorious for arriving late, taking long lunches or spending parts of their day on the golf course.

During his first few months in office, Modi developed a reputation for paying unannounced visits to government offices.

Fear of being caught playing truant triggered a rise in attendance levels among civil servants and Delhi’s main golf course has reportedly been largely deserted on week days."
2442,"Google leased all 1.9 million square feet of Moffett Place, a Sunnyvale office complex under development by Jay Paul Co.

Google Inc. has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in Sunnyvale and Redwood City that boost the company's Silicon Valley footprint by 2.8 million square feet – about the size of the Empire State Building and enough room for more than 10,000 workers.

Even by Google standards, the latest transactions are blockbusters: In one deal, Google has agreed to lease all of Jay Paul Co.'s Moffett Place, a 1.9 million square foot office campus currently under construction in Sunnyvale. It's a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in Silicon Valley and perhaps the state of California.

In a separate but no less notable deal, Mountain View-based Google completed the purchase of six buildings from Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital totaling about 934,000 square feet at Redwood City's Pacific Shores office park. It's Google's first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market.

""Google is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode,"" said Amber Schiada, director of research for real estate services firm JLL.

The deals — both of which I previously reported were in the works — were confirmed by sources close to the transactions. Google declined to comment for this story. Blackstone didn't return inquiries. Jay Paul's longtime broker Phil Mahoney of Newmark Cornish & Carey, would only say that Moffett Place is off the market.

Google's expansion on the Peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 Great Recession as the world's biggest Web-search advertising company has bought and leased building after building, radiating out from its Mountain View headquarters. Its real estate growth dwarfs even that of Cisco Systems Inc.'s expansion during the 1990s.

Terms of the latest deals were not disclosed, but sources estimated the Redwood City sale at around $625 per square foot, or $583.75 million. That would make it perhaps Google's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in Silicon Valley.

""I welcome them to our city and I look forward to working with them,"" said Redwood City Mayor Jeffrey Gee in an interview this afternoon. ""For a long time I would go around and say, 'Redwood City is one of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. With Google and everything going on, we're not a secret anymore.'""

Aside from sheer size, the deals are notable for several reasons. First, they showcase Google's incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing, self-driving cars and robotics — all of which could be huge space users on their own.

Google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years. Yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion, suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs. Google counted 55,030 employees globally as of Sept. 30, according to its most recent quarterly report, up 18 percent — or 8,600 Googlers — from a year ago.

The transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table. Schiada noted that Moffett Place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in Silicon Valley. In Redwood City's Pacific Shores, which is more than 90 percent leased, I'm told Google will honor all current tenants' leases for now, but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead.

""A big question is what does this leave for tenants,"" Schiada said, speaking specifically about the Moffett Place deal. ""It also increases rates, because the supply becomes more limited.""

Still, that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product, she added.

""This deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development, which could prompt more developers to move forward,"" she said.

Jim Beeger, a veteran broker with Colliers International, said in the short term, the Sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market.

The transaction could ""cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site,"" he said. ""Moffett Place will be difficult to replicate, and those who lingered no longer have this option.""

Sethena Leiker, senior analyst for Cushman & Wakefield's Silicon Valley office, agreed.

""There's not a lot of spec development coming,"" she said. ""If you want to take any new space, you're going to have to take something that's proposed.""

One result, Beeger said, could be a ""trickle-down effect"" of growing tenants moving to other areas of Santa Clara County that have available sites.

Score for Sunnyvale

Google's lease at Moffett Place is a huge win for San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co., if one that's not entirely unexpected. Jay Paul already leased 949,000 square feet to Google in Sunnyvale at a nearby campus called Technology Corners, making Google a natural prospect for the new development.

And while Google has not yet started moving into Technology Corners, the company has also been growing elsewhere in Sunnyvale this year, snapping up the old Juniper Networks headquarters (424,000 square feet) and former head office of Palm Computing Inc. (285,000 square feet). And it's rumored that a fund, CBRE Global Investors, that's buying up land all around Sunnyvale's Moffett Park business district is actually acting on behalf of Google.

Yet landing Google wasn't guaranteed when Jay Paul started building Moffett Place earlier this year on spec. Other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property, according to sources. The rent Google is paying isn't known, but Jay Paul was asking $3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis, or not including utilities, taxes and fees.

Redwood City action

In Redwood City, Google picks a up a major chunk one of Silicon Valley's marquee office campuses. The 10-building, 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds.

Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold two buildings to Shorenstein, the San Francisco-based landlord. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago. Informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $525 per square foot. Google's acquisition this week is only for the six Blackstone/Starwood buildings.

As I reported earlier this month, a new owner could build even more office space at Pacific Shores. New zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways.

Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port.

Mayor Gee said the city would be happy to work with Google on such a plan, should the search company decide to go in that direction.

""One of the things that's always a challenge with new forms of transportation is, is there enough there there,"" he said. ""With Google, that potentially brings the there there.""

2444,"A luxe Viking island owned by the world's sixth-richest athlete, golfer Tiger Woods, is up for sale, the Telegraph of London reports.
Naturally it has room for putting practice, with half a dozen tee boxes and a golf hole. It also has a private ferry, stables and pasture land, its own protected bay, a ""mini-mansion"" of a villa, a hunting lodge and a landing strip.

Oh -- and it also has a ""hill fort"" dating back to the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages that was more recently (about a thousand years ago) a Viking stronghold. Visitors can take forest trails up to the top for views like those ancient man might have seen.

Listing agent Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands confirmed in the Telegraph report: ""This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden anymore.""

Called Stora Rullingen, it's on Lake Malaren, about an hour from Stockholm. Three international airports are within 60 miles.

Woods married Elin Nordegren, a former model born and raised in Stockholm, in 2004. They had two children -- daughter Sam in June 2007 and son Charlie in February 2009 -- but their marriage unraveled when Charlie was a baby. Nordegren learned during Thanksgiving 2009 that Woods had been cheating on her, and soon after, his very public one-man SUV crash revealed their marital problems to the world.
Subsequent news reports said his dalliances involved perhaps a dozen women. Their divorce was finalized in August 2010.

Vladi Private Islands declines to disclose the asking price except upon application, but a listing at Private Islands Online prices the property at 6 million euros, or about $7.1 million at today's exchange rates. The Vladi listing pegs the property at about 62 acres; Private Islands Online says its about 82 acres."

But it’s almost certainly not true.

A screengrab of the likely untrue story of a priest who supposedly died and saw a female God. The picture of the “priest” appears to be a stock photo, not a picture of an actual priest. (Image via monitor.co.ug)

The story of the Catholic priest who supposedly died briefly and saw a female God has gained massive traction online, sparking debates on Reddit and getting picked up by everyone from the Dallas/Ft. Worth radio station KVIL-FM to viral news sites such as Inquisitr.

Yet the story does not appear to spring from any news outlets close to Boston, Massachusetts, where the priest was reportedly working.

Instead, the “story” was first reported by the Daily Monitor, a newspaper based in the African nation of Uganda.

Why would a remote African nation be first to an American faith story?

Because it pulled the tale from the World News Daily Report, a “satirical” website.

To add insult to injury, the images of “Father O’Neal” that accompany the stories appear to be stock photos (as Reddit user NewdAccount pointed out), not pictures of an actual priest.

It seems this story is another bogus tale in need of debunking, like the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory or the fake report of a military coup against the Obama administration over the revelation of an alleged Colin Powell affair.

Spokespersons for the archdiocese of Boston were not immediately available for comment Sunday morning.

2446,"RESIDENTS fear a mechanical six-foot-tall carol singing bear could be hit with an ASBO after receiving complaints his festive tunes were causing a noise nuisance.

Although the bear, named Bernard by staff at The Loft café in Ampthill Road, Shefford, stands outside each day bringing joy to passing children who run past him trying to make him sing and dance, it would seem he doesn’t make everyone so merry.

On Monday an enforcement officer from Central Bedfordshire Council visited the café to inform staff that there had been complaints made about Bernard’s singing because he was causing a public nuisance.

According to staff at The Loft, opened by husband and wife team Rob and Teresa Farndon in October last year, Bernard was out every day in December last year spreading some festive cheer without any complaints being made and has been put away at 4pm every night since he took up his post again two weeks ago.

Employee Abbie McGee said: “The children love him and there’s even one woman who used to put 20p in his pocket every time she went past.

“As soon as you shut the door you can’t hear him anymore, he isn’t loud. I can’t believe there have been complaints, is no-one allowed to have fun anymore? It seems really silly that someone would moan about a bear when we’re on the high street where there is constant noise from the pubs and traffic.

“He only sings Christmas songs.”

Ellen, a regular at The Loft, who has asked for her last name not to be used, said: ""Bearing in mind that he is not 'singing' loudly and actually cannot be heard in the cafe, I and a great many others in town fail to understand the problem.

""There are so many issues that do require council attention locally that I find it ludicrous that taxpayers' money is being used to effectively gag this popular 'toy'. Notwithstanding the fact that it is Christmas time and with all the serious issues people have to deal with on a daily basis its actually great to see people smiling as they walk or drive past and see him singing and dancing away.

""I fear he could end up with an ASBO and that would be more than I could bear.""

A spokesman for Central Bedfordshire Council said: “We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation. 

""The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.”

Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been 'gagged'."
2447,"The story of English teacher Lucita Sandoval’s affair with a 16-year-old student went viral after video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked. But the video in question is from a porn website, and features a woman and a college student, a local newspaper found.

A salacious sex tape from an Argentinian teacher’s affair with her 16-year-old student is likely nothing more than an Internet hoax.

An Argentinian newspaper debunked the racy story. While the actual tape may be real, it features a woman and a college student ― not a teacher and her pupil, Nuevo Diario reported.

The story of teacher Lucita Sandoval went viral after video allegedly showed the 26-year-old having sex with an underage student from her school in the city of Santiago del Estero. The scandalous story maintained the boy filmed her without her consent and then shared the 23-minute clip with his friends on WhatsApp.

The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it.

But the woman in the video is not a teacher ― and the “boy” is a college student, the Santiago del Estero newspaper found.

While the tape is real, it appears to be from a porn website.

The real woman who appears in the clip, identified by a friend, is from a different Argentine city, Corrientes, the newspaper reported. She does have a teaching degree, but was not employed at the school in question. The newspaper tracked down the man in the video, too, who is well over the age of 16 and in college.

It’s unclear if “Lucita Sandoval” is a real teacher who was the victim of the online hoax or an entirely made-up person."
2448,"Eleven commercial jets have reportedly been stolen in recent weeks in Libya, and Western intelligence agencies have begun warning they could be used in terror attacks on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the devastating Osama bin Laden-orchestrated attacks on New York and Washington that left nearly 3,000 dead.
According to a report in the Free Beacon, the jets were taken by Islamist militias in Libya, and reports distributed within the U.S. government “included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack … on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks …”

One official in the report assembled by the highly respected Bill Gertz said, “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Gertz now is senior editor of the Free Beacon, but he built his career during 27 years as reporter, editor and columnist with the Washington Times. He’s also authored six books and his online biography reveals the state-run Xinhua news agency in 2006 identified him as the No. 1 “anti-China expert” in the world.

His report about the missing jetliners notes authorities have a high level of concern because of the convergence of the cases of missing airplanes and the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack.

What do YOU think? Do you fear for America’s safety? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported.

The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August.

“The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,” the report said. “Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.”

The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August.

Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said.

And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya.

Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert.

Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos.

Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya’s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that “credible intelligence” reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date.

Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” he said.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Gertz’s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?” asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. “Even empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.”"
2450,"ISIS militants released gruesome video footage this afternoon of the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley as a message to the U.S. to stop intervening in Iraq. Foley, a freelancer who contributed to the Global Post, was first captured in Libya in 2012, released, and then kidnapped again around Thanksgiving 2012 by unidentified gunmen in Syria. He was 39 years old.

The (extremely disturbing) video can be viewed here. @Mujahid4life tweeted stills from it, which are (aside from the one below), sickeningly graphic.

The Global Post reported the circumstances of his disappearance last year, after attempting to keep the news quiet for fear of Foley's safety:

Foley had set off toward the border in a car about an hour before his capture. A witness, a Syrian, later recounted over the phone to a journalist in Turkey that an unmarked car intercepted Foley. The witness said men holding kalashnikovs shot into the air and forced Jim out of the car.

The witness said he noticed nothing that would indicate whether the aggressors were rebel fighters, individuals looking for a ransom, members of a pro-government militia, or a religious-based group with other motivations.
He was held captive for 635 days.

In 2013, Foley's family set up a Find James Foley website for him, which states that he's the oldest of five children. His friend, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote about him for Syria Deeply last year:

Jim sees the good in nearly everything and everyone. He is a master motivator. ""You got this, dude!"" he'll say. ""That story's great, just file it already."" ...

It is believed the old lady started at first to raise her own cats but finally decided to capture neighboring cats because she “got too much attached to the little critters”, she admitted in court.

It is estimated she used over 30 cats to make one single fur coat and over 20 fur coats were found in her house during the arrest

The retired fashion designer lured neighborhood cats with food and skinned them in her basement where she dried the skins. She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.

He further explained that North Koreans consider Scotland, which leans more towards leftist ideals than England, more suitable to ""deal with"".
Moreover, the North Korean leader is said to have been keenly interested in Scottish affairs during the Referendum Debate of September 2014, wherein voters decided ""yes"" or ""no"" on ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"".
""Plus, North Koreans love whisky,"" said Madden, before elaborating, ""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency"". The restaurants, if they did open, would serve all nationally popular delicacies, giving the Scots a chance to experience North Korea, without actually going there.

2454,"A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.


On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

“I never lied to him,” Chandler sayd. “We were together for such a short period of time, I never had a chance to tell him about my life.”"
2455,"Cristian Bale is eyeing — or i-ing, if you prefer — the role of Apple founder Steve Jobs.

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news.

Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Trainspotting"") is directing the film, which may be called ""Jobs,"" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama ""The Social Network"" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography ""Steve Jobs,"" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011.

The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and ""Gone Girl"" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point.

Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out.

Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the ""entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time."" He added, ""Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch — backstage before a product launch. The first one being the Mac; and the second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple; and the third one being the iPod."""

One citizen in the Province of Tarif used his snow camel to promote the colours of local teams, drawing praise from the fans, while another opted for the traditional ghitra and agal to cover the head of the snowman he built.
However, it was not all fun for Saudis after a religious scholar said that building snowmen or snow animals was not acceptable in Islam.
The fatwa, by Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed, said that building snowmen or any replica of an animal, even if it is for fun or recreation, could not be condoned. Only lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings could be imitated, the fatwa said.

No date was mentioned about when the fatwa was issued, but it was widely circulated on social networks, triggering a wide and often heated online debate mainly among Gulf nationals.
Those who supported the fatwa said that building snowmen was a crude imitation of the West.

Tears of joy: The app developer's parents burst into tears in reaction to their son's generosity

The touching video, which has been viewed nearly 130,000 times in the last 24 hours, and counting, begins with Joe Riquelme sitting on a couch with his parents and their pet dog.

Looking visibly nervous and struggling to keep his emotions in check, Riquelme tells his mom and dad that he has one more Christmas gift for them: a slightly dog-eared envelope folded in half.

Inside, there are documents from Bank of America accompanied by a handwritten note that reads: 'Your house is paid off. Merry Xmas. - Joe.'

In the corner, Riquelme drew a box with a list of three things his parents had done for their family with check marks next to each one: raising kids, college loans, mortgage.

Confronted with the note, Riguelme's mother covers her mouth in shock and bursts into tears of joy mingled with laughter as her son labors to keep his composure.

The overwhelmed woman then passes the envelope to her husband, who also begins to weep.

‘I love you. Thank you, Papi,' Riquelme's mom exclaims through sobs while showering him with hugs and kisses.

2463,"ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

However, the prank seems to have duped the internet, with his name quickly trending on Twitter.

A false story, published on US website National Report, alleged that the identity of the British street artist had finally been revealed and he had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police and is being held “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

The story claimed that Banksy’s London art studio had been raided, where “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” were found, along with ID thought to belong to the famed anonymous street artist, which allegedly identified him as Liverpool-born Paul Homer.

However, a quick google search shows that the quotes were originally published in 2013 on hoax website on PRLog.

Nonetheless, the joke struck a nerve with Louise Mensch, who fell wholeheartedly for the ‘news’ and chastised the police for arresting the street artist and not focusing on other more pressing issues.

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?

After she was notified that the report was, in fact, a prank, she quickly apologised to the police.

OK. Apparently it's bullshit. Sorry @metpoliceuk #Banksy

Fear not world, Banksy is still roaming free, spray can in hand."
2469,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the Predator. The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.
According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems. The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) – of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give US policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.
As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses. The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.
A second option could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of US drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Update A regional security expert reports Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil."
2470,"The mystery surrounding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a Workers' Party anniversary celebration.

It was the first time in three years Kim hadn't attended the event in Pyongyang, which today marked the party's 69th anniversary.

But while Kim wasn't there in person, a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, both of whom also ruled North Korea.

Kim Jong Un was absent from the Workers' Party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang today, but a flower basket baring his name was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, as were other baquets from North Koreans

North Korean military personnel march as they visit the statues of late leaders, Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il on Mansudae, as they mark the anniversary celebrations

It was the first time in three years, Kim hadn't attended the event amid reports his sister has taken over leadership as he recovers from a leg injury

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo-jong (left), who has already been identified as Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has reportedly taken leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury

His absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury.

The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that.

An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill.

In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week.

State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover.

North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say.

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship previously said

Because Pyongyang is publicly acknowledging Kim's 'discomfort', many analysts believe that he's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious. When his father, Kim Jong Il, suffered major health problems late in his rule, state media said nothing.

But each day that passes only adds to the speculation. Kim missed a meeting of the country's parliament late last month, and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father's election as ruling party head.

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, appeared to suggest Ms Kim had taken control.

He told The Telegraph: 'Kim's sister may be young, but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in North Korea, relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out.

'No-one can touch the Kim family and it doesn't matter that she is young, inexperienced and a woman. She is a Kim and that's enough.'

According to South Korea's JoongAng Daily, Ms Kim is already in charge of her brother's daily schedule, 'as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style'.

Health fear: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011

Prior to the emergence of the latest claims, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership insisted Kim was in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over his health and grip on power.

The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury.

'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.

'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight.

'He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

He was last seen attending a concert with his wife Ri Sol-ju on September 3 but has vanished from public since

Kim has not been pictured by state media, which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail, since September 3

'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.

'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Shots fired across border after activists urge North Korea to rise up against 'dictator' Kim

North and South Korea exchanged machinegun fire today after the Communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un.

No casualties were reported in the exchange of fire, a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states.

They remain legally at war and are separated by the Demilitarized Zone, known as the DMZ.

North Korean defectors launched balloons from the South today to send across leaflets and DVDs condemning the regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as American dollars

The balloons carried bags of leaflets and anti-Kim DVDs underneath. But they prompted North Korean border troops to fire across the border, which led to an exchange of fire

South Korean activists had sent leaflets critical of the North Korean regime flying into the North from the town, prompting shots to be fired by the North's guards to try to bring down the balloons.

South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said.

Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said.

There was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later, he added.

Local residents of Hwangsan-ri township in the border area of Yeoncheon were evacuated to shelters as a precaution.

While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare.

In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict.

The balloon launch from Hapsuri was one of several planned to coincide with North Korea's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party.

Seoul allowed the exercises to go ahead, despite prior warnings from Pyongyang of 'catastrophic' consequences.

Some of the balloons carried messages denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, who has not seen seen in public for more than a month.

North Korea has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by South Korean private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in Pyongyang, vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat.

'This is the first time North Korea actually took an action against leaflets. It spilt cold water over the South-North relationship after the high-level delegation visit from North. It will strain the relations again,' said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said.

On Tuesday, a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula's west coast and fired shots back before retreating, a South Korean defence official said.

There were no casualties on the South Korean side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other's vessel, he told Reuters.

Evidence of the shots fired by North Korea could be seen on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone which separates the two states, including this bullet hole (centre). Both sides are technically still at war"
2471,"Gill Rosenberg is reported to have been captured with several other women fighting with Kurds

There is “no hard evidence” that Isis has captured a Canadian-Israeli woman fighting with the Kurds in Syria, an expert has said, as officials struggle to discover the truth of militants’ claims the woman is just one of a group of female fighters to have been kidnapped near Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, is a Canadian-born woman and resident of Tel Aviv who volunteered to fight alongside Kurdish fighters in Syria.

According to a blog linked to Isis (also known as Islamic State), which has been quoted by Israeli media reports, Ms Rosenberg was captured alongside several female fighters near Kobani. These reports have not yet been confirmed by Israeli officials, and the Canadian foreign ministry has said it is “pursuing all appropriate channels” to confirm Ms Rosenberg’s whereabouts.

“I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Ya’alon told an Israeli television channel when asked about the reports.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said that while the rumours swirl around the state of Ms Rosenberg’s capture, there is “no hard evidence” to show that she has been taken by Isis.

“No photos of her have been circulated by Isis,” Mr Winter said, “which means there is no hard evidence that she has actually been captured. At the same time, the YPG have denied the rumours, and the Free Syrian Army’s representatives in Kobani said the rumours haven’t been confirmed to them either.”

Mr Winter said despite the lack of physical evidence, the YPG and the Free Syrian Army are “not above deliberate obfuscation to make Isis look weaker,” but that it is impossible to know the truth without any official pictures or statements.

Others have refuted rumours of Ms Rosenberg’s kidnap however, claiming that she simply has no internet access and will be updating her status on Facebook as soon as she had a connection.

Oliver Brimo, who appears to be a friend of Ms Rosenberg, posted on her Facebook profile on Monday: “To those who are concerned about Gill Rosenberg’s safety. Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause she has no internet access. Once she has internet access she will be updating her status [sic].”

He added: “Isis’s supporters launched a rumour on social media that she was captured in #Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300km from Kobani [sic].”

Mr Brimo told The Independent on Monday that his source claims to have seen Ms Rosenberg ""in person hours ago"".

On 20 November, Ms Rosenberg posted that her Facebook page and friend requests were to be managed by someone else until she had access again, which she expected to happen approximately two weeks later, around the second week of December.

Messages of concern have flooded her Facebook page since the claims emerged of her kidnapping.

Ms Rosenberg is a former member of the Israel Defence Force. A source linked to the YPG, the Kurds’ dominant fighting force in northern Syria, told Reuters News Agency in November that Ms Rosenberg was their first female foreign recruit and had crossed into Syria to fight Isis.

2472,"While it’s not clear exactly how waterproof the Apple Watch is, people who prefer to take their timepieces with them in the shower may have a new reason to be excited about the arrival of Apple’s new smartwatch.

Tim Cook told an Apple Store employee in Germany that he wears his Apple Watch with him in the shower, without any problem, according to a report from French site iGen. Considering how busy Cook is, his watch habit makes sense to stay on top of the time and any important notifications.

Tim Cook
Tim Cook
The Watch’s ability to survive in water isn’t surprising, since it’s designed as a workout accessory in addition to something people wear around town. The device has to be at least somewhat resistant to human sweat, and in protecting it against that kind of moisture, it makes sense that Apple’s engineers would make it showerproof as well.

Apple hasn’t claimed that it’s fully waterproof, which may make it less appealing to swimmers, divers and other people who want their timepieces to survive an extended dip in the water. There’s also the matter of the Watch’s battery life: Cook said that he has to take it off every night to charge.

It won’t be long until consumers will be able to try out all of that for themselves. Cook revealed last month that the watch will be available for sale in April."
2473,"Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, might be leading the hermit kingdom instead of her brother, a recent report from Seoul-based think tank, North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity (NKIS) revealed.

According to NKIS on October 1, Kim Jong-un — who has failed to appear at official events since early September — is getting medical treatment at Bonghwa Clinic from both domestic and foreign medical teams. Meanwhile, in his absence,  Kim Yo-jong is charged with handling important government decisions.

An unnamed source told NKIS that a decision to give Kim Jong-un extended medical treatment was made at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on September 6. The meeting was reportedly held at Kim Yo-jong’s suggestion.

As a result of the meeting, Pyongyang decided four things. First, to give special and extended medical treatment to Kim Jong-un in order to quickly restore his health. Second, all North Korean high level officials and party members should be responsible in following Kim’s previous orders. Third, the party and army should be on wartime-like alert while Kim Jong-un is out of commission. Lastly, all the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better.

Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his wife, Kim Yong-hui. She was first spotted at a photo session for participants at the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party of Korea in September 2010, when she stood next to her father’s personal secretary.

She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, as she accompanied her brother in voting for the Supreme People’s Assembly. She was identified as a “senior official” of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. She is widely seen as having taken over the role of her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the wife of the executed Jang Song-thaek. Kim Kyong-hui supported her elder brother Kim Jong-il during his rule.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” said Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

Meanwhile, speculation over Kim Jong-un’s sustained absence continues unabated.

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source, that he is suffering from gout.

A Daily Mirror report said that Kim Jong-un is addicted to Swiss cheese, which may have contributed to his health problems.

Curtis Melvin, a researcher with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, told Foreign Policy that Kim Jong un spends much of his time at the family compounds in Wonsan and Kangdong. The family compound in Kangdong is where Kim Jong-il recovered from his stroke.

In addition, Free North Korea Radio (FNK) reported on September 29 that Kim hadsurgery on his ankle. The surgery was reportedly successful.

However, the South Korean government has refused to confirm that Kim is suffering from any health problem.

“I think it is hard to relate Kim’s absence to his health since there used to be a time when Kim disappeared from official events [for] over ten days,” said Lim Byeong-chul, a spokesman of the Ministry of Unification."

When Eduard Neetz and Casey Dean were 13 an 14 respectively, they took a trip to their local McDonald's restaurant in Adelaide to grab some food after a party.

The men picked up an extra for their mate Jono who never showed. That was 20 years ago.

Jono told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke, and 'he hasn't been back yet', the men told The Project.

Eduard and Casey have kept the burger under lock and key for the past two decades, and though it looks as though it was picked up at a Maccas just moments ago, the Quarter Pounder is 'rock hard'.

'It's rock hard, absolutely solid as a brick' the friends said while showing off their prized possession.

After all that time kept behind closed doors, Casey told the program it was time to 'free the burger' and boys have released a song on iTunes dedicated to their 'Senior Burger'.

'As opposed to a Junior Burger', Casey joked.

All proceeds raised from sales of their song go directly to BeyondBlue and Carry Bickmore soon asked the pair how much she would have to donate for them to sample the burger.

Despite all The Project hosts trying to get Eduard and Casey to take a bite out of the age-old snack and the men playing along, quite quickly they flat out refused.

'No way you guys are sick!' Casey laughed. 'It's a 20-year-old burger we're not eating it, no way.'

The men have set up a website, Twitter account and Facebook page for Senior Burger, where fans can purchase merchandise and listen to their serenade to the Quarter Pounder."

2477,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

2478,"The fungi was found by TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh

A hallucinogenic toadstool mushroom is growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.

The red and white spotted Amanita muscaria species - also known as fly agaric - has been discovered by Alan Titchmarsh while on tour of the grounds with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

The discovery of the mushroom - which is likely to have grown on the 40-acre land without being specifically cultivated - was recorded during a 12-month study for ITV show The Queen's Garden, which is to be aired on Christmas Day.

Mr Titchmarsh asks Professor Crawley if the fungi is edible, to which he replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all the high without any of the sickness.”

Mr Titchmarsh, known for presenting BBC gardening programme Ground Force and the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show, then says: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to some normal mushrooms”.

“Not something to try at home,” he added.

Chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid found in the fungi cause psychoactive effects such as drowsiness, hallucinations, mood changes, euphoria and disassociation.

The plant has a long history of religious and shamanic use dating back around 10,000 years.

However, unlike psilocybin mushrooms - which were reclassified to Class A in 2006 and have been more popular for recreational use - the legal status of selling fly agaric in the UK remains complicated. Possession is not illegal.

The physical effects are described as ""undesirable"" and the chemicals can carry risks of poisoning and death, according to drug advice charity Talk to Frank.

The mushrooms are culturally depicted in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers video games and in Disney's musical production Fantasia."

Italian media reports that the nun, 31, originally from South America, was part of the all-female convent in Macerata.

She is believed to have been pregnant when she arrived from South America in June.

Doctors performed an ultrasound only to discover that the woman was heavily pregnant. She was taken to the delivery room where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy soon after.

The Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino said it up to the unidentified sister if she wanted to stay within the Church. It has been reported that the nuns want to help raise the baby together at the convent

He also dismissed calls for the nun to be excommunicated, saying: “Excommunication is something really big and cannot be issued for having a baby.”"
2480,"A tour of the royal grounds at Buckingham Palace went through the looking glass when so-called “magic mushrooms” were found in the garden, The Telegraph reports .

The discovery was made while a television crew was touring the gardens in preparation for an ITV television show called The Queen’s Garden, which will air on Christmas day. While taping the show gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh and ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley noticed some red and white spotted fungi. Titchmarsh asked, “Is it edible?” and, according to The Telegraph, Professor Crawley replied, “That depends what you mean.”

The fungus found in the Queen’s garden was a naturally occurring Amanita muscaria (no one suspects Queen Elizabeth II of cultivating the magic mushroom) that according to Prof. Crawley is “eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.” The fungus, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, does have hallucinogenic properties, but it is not the same as the illicit psychoactive mushroom that contains the illegal drug psilocybin. Still, Titchmarsch wisely replied, “I won’t be eating any of that.” Titchmarsh told The Sun that he was surprised to happen upon the red and white-headed toadstool, “That was a surprise, but it shows just how varied the species are.”

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of the Amanita muscaria. It is understood that the mushrooms grew naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there. Palace officials made it clear to the AP that mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens."
2481,"An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.

“Normally, when we get an abandonment, it’s usually a staffie and we don’t tend to get many offers to re-home them, but when it’s an unusual breed or a particularly cute one, then we get a lot of interest.

“I’m sure Kai’s story has tugged at a lot of heartstrings.”

The Scottish SPCA has asked for anyone with any information about the ‘cruel incident’ to contact them.

Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006."
2485,"Although Apple has given us our first peek at the Apple Watch, so far we don’t know much about it, including when it will be released or how much its many versions will cost.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

As for shipping date, iGen.fr’s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date. That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine’s Day present right now, isn’t it?"
2489,"Sorry to disappoint, fans of Led Zeppelin, but it doesn’t look like a reunion will be happening any time soon.

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes."
2490,"While other global leaders rant their exasperations and anger towards the extremists ISIS fighters and its entire caliphate, one leader may just take matters in his own hands. Jordan's King Abdullah II, visibly shaken and angered over the death of one of his kingdom’s military pilots, has vowed to exact revenge. Reports in Arabic-language newspapers hinted he may don his pilot suit and drop the bombs himself.

Photos have emerged over the Internet of a poker-faced Jordan King Abdullah II who was wearing a fatigue green army uniform. The reports emerged after the Jordanian leader vowed a relentless war against the ISIS right on their own territory. The portal dailycaller said the king leader, a trained pilot, “may fly a bomber himself on Thursday.”

The news of the burning of Jordanian pilot First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS happened while the king was in the U.S. King Abdullah is a strong ally of Washington and London. Al-Kasasbeh got captured when the F-16 fighter he was flying crashed over the jihadi Syrian headquarters in Raqqa in December. He had been burned alive in a cage by the terrorist army. In a closed-door meeting with U.S. lawmakers following the video’s release, King Abdullah II said the ISIS will see a retribution it hasn’t seen before.

Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the pilot's father, said earlier the 53-year-old monarch had personally attended to the coordination for the release of his son, which had ended in vain. “The King told me that he was following up personally on Muath’s case,"" the grieving father told the Jordan Times. ""He said Crown Prince Hussein, may God protect him, is no dearer to me than Muath.” The younger al-Kaseasbeh had graduated from King Hussein Air College, the academy named for Abdullah's father.

King Abdullah said they will pursue the black-clad terrorist army until they ran “out of fuel and bullets.” Quoting lines from the ‘Unforgiven,’ a movie led by American actor Clint Eastwood, he said the death of one of Jordan’s sons will call not only for the death of his killers, but also their “wives and all their friends, and burn his damn house down.”

Duncan Hunter, California Republican Rep., told the Washington Examiner that King Abdullah II has called his officials to arrange “more sorties than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow.” Mohammad Momani, Jordanian government spokesman, quoted by Fox News, said the country’s response to the assassination “...will be swift. Jordanians’ wrath will devastate Daesh’s ranks.”

""All the State's military and security agencies are developing their options. Jordan's response will be heard by the world at large but this response on the security and military level will be announced at the appropriate time,"" Momani said.

Jon Alterman, director of the Center for Strategic & International Studies' Middle East Program, told Fox News that Jordan’s words were not just mere lip service or emotional outbursts. ""Their ability to do difficult things with small numbers of highly trained people is up there with some of the best militaries in the world.""

David Schenker, former adviser to Defense Secretary Donald Rumseld and director of the Arab politics program at The Washington Institute, said Jordan's military force, ""regionally speaking, they are people of high quality.""

2492,"SAN SEVERINO - Go to the hospital accusing a terrible stomach ache and comes out clutching their arms a pretty baby. It would just be a story with a happy ending, a birth like many, one that comes from the lanes of the department of obstetrics and gynecology of ""Bartolomeo Eustachio"" San Severino Marche were it not for the fact that the protagonist of the race to the hospital this time it was a new mother any but a nun who had sworn, years ago, chastity to the Lord with eternal fidelity.
She had arrived at the hospital, accompanied by her sisters, from the emergency room. Exactly complained of stomach pains but ultrasound has revealed the mystery and the doctor on duty invited nun and sisters to immediately take the road of the department of obstetrics not without a moment of embarrassment. Amniotic sac broke and team immediately into action to deliver the nun. In the story, of course, little is known about the same even if it took him nothing to go around the country and come out not only dall'ovattato silence ensured by medical and nursing staff who witnessed the happy event but also from that, more religious in this case, the convent which would seem to be even a cloistered monastery in the area (in San Severino there are two, the monastery of St. Catherine and the St. Clare, both in the area of Catsello). Nothing leaked, of course, on the identity of religious, nor on physical features of the infant. Mystery over whether resembles more the mother rather than the father. And if you do not ask to be born was a boy or a girl as in lane embarrassments are palpable. We only know that the mother of the unborn child, the original of a state in South America, would arrive in Macerata for some time and would find accommodation, perhaps refuge in a cloistered in our province. It is also hard to say whether the sister has or less confessed his sin, not venial, to his superior. We know, however, that the religious would come first to the emergency room, and later would bring up the ward, accompanied by other sisters who, even before a miracle, they entrusted the prayer of the Lord who in the meantime was to come to light. The entrance to the acceptance took place Sunday and was, however, a great day of celebration for the arrival of a new life. So, really embarrassed general, were followed by the team that performed the childbirth exciting phases that accompanied the same. No flowers at the entrance of the bedroom which these days has ensured the anonymity that the new mother , however, seems to have decided to keep the small and that maybe now will be transferred elsewhere, probably in a family home. Certainly before Sunday the nun would not be left unattended, this is what I would tell her that the religious have shared cloistered in recent months. And certainly in the structure that housed it, the nun could hardly have had contact with the outside world. Although the ways of the Lord, you know, are really endless. Not surprised, months ago, the news of the birth of another sister, this time the Congolese. The child came to light was first given to a pair of Tolentino and then taken to the adoptive parents with an unexpected and unexpected measure of the Supreme Court finally entrusted to a halfway house. In that case the natural mother had abandoned the little girl, at birth . The child for two and a half years had been grown by two new parents that if the view were then subtract."
2495,"Islamic State militants appear to have killed missing American journalist James Wright Foley, if a video that surfaced Tuesday is to be believed. 

Foley was a freelancer who frequently reported for the Global Post and Agence France-Presse about ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. When Foley first disappeared in Syria, reports indicated that he had been captured by pro-government forces. Instead, it appears that his captors were members of ISIS. He had previously been kidnapped in Libya. 

The video that surfaced Tuesday first shows a clip from President Obama's press conference calling for air strikes against ""the terrorist group ISIL."" About halfway in, a man believed to be Foley speaks in English to his family. He's on his knees, with an ISIS guard standing over him. In a [likely ISIS-scripted] speech, he blames Obama and the U.S. government for his impending death and implores his family not to take a penny from the government. He then addresses his brother, John, who is in the U.S. Air Force. 

""I died that day, John,"" he says, referring to U.S. air strikes against the militant group. ""When your colleagues dropped that bomb on those people, they signed my death certificate.""

When the video reorients itself to focus back on Foley and his executioner, the mike previously hooked up to his shirt is gone. The militant spouts off an angry tirade against the United States, and the camera cuts away after the first few seconds of the beheading. 

At the end of the video, ISIS militants parade another captive journalist, Steven Sotloff, who they threaten will be the next victim if the U.S. government's policy toward the militant group doesn't change.

The video was taken down from Youtube shortly after it was publicized. A HuffPo blogger who claimed to have shared the video apologized for doing so:

As of November 2013, at least 30 journalists were being held captive in Syria. Many more have been killed in the ongoing conflict."

A Macedonian man chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin after he was dumped by his girlfriend for his lack of bedroom skills.

The man told medics he felt his small-sized penis was to blame for the split.

And, he said, as it was useless he decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he could not stop the bleeding.

And the jilted lover was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

CEN   Shock injury: Oliver Ilic chopped of his penis and threw it in the bin after he was dumped by his lover

The bloody penis was delivered to the local hospital but a surgeon skilled enough to carry out the reattachment couldn't be found.

Ilic was then transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje, where surgeons managed to reattach the penis in a complicated five-hour surgery.

They said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.

2497,"If 9to5Mac’s latest findings are true, than Apple’s biggest product of the year could be the MacBook Air. (You know, right behind the Apple Watch.) According to early reports, Apple has completely redesigned the MacBook Air, ditching the full-sized USB port, MagSafe connector, and SD card slots for something entirely different.

9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman writes: “The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.”

profilecompare copy
9to5Mac's artist Michael Steeber designed renditions of what the new Air could look like. Here's a side view of the rumored 12-inch Air (left) compared to the current 11-inch Air (right).

Why this matters: We already have an 11-inch MacBook Air... and a 13-inch, too. So, doesn’t a 12-inch just seem unnecessary? To keep up the MacBook Air’s reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable, it makes sense to keep the Air’s screen size at 13-inches or less. However, something smaller than 11-inches will just be too small. So, the 12-inch could actually fill that “just right” sweet spot nicely.

It’s not all about the size
However, if 9to5Mac’s design estimates are correct, this is the start of a new design shift for the MacBook Air. We’ll see features that are slimmer and more compact than before, with an edge-to-edge keyboard, a modified trackpad, and a thinner profile (yes, the Air will actually be getting smaller).

Apple could also introduce USB Type-C on the new Air, which means it would no longer need a MagSafe port, as reports on USB Type-C indicate that it can be used to power computers. 9to5Mac believes this single port could be used as a sort of hub, allowing users to plug in multiple devices to the Air.

Of course, this is just speculation at this point—Apple has yet to announce a new MacBook Air officially—but 9to5Mac’s artist renditions are pretty cool. Check out their full report for more details."
2498,"In case you missed it, Vogue Magazine, one of the most glamorous institutions in the country has been dealing with the least glamorous issue ever: a rat infestation.

The rodents have literally been living it up in Vogue’s new luxurious digs at 1 World Trade Center in New York City. Reportedly, the rats took up residence in Anna Wintour’s office and have moved into the magazine’s world famous accessories closet.

Gawker reported that the critters have made Vogue’s infamous editor-in-chief scared to enter her office without taking precautions first.

“The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it…”

A source told People that: “the girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

The rats have also reportedly eaten holes into shoe boxes and left droppings on the floor of the accessories closet. It’s believed that Vogue’s newest office mates made their way into the office through the ventilation system.

Anna Wintour’s new office. 

Call me petty, but after this headline made me gag, it also made me laugh hysterically. I know that vermin infestations are no laughing matter but there are just too many hilarious visuals that this headline conjures up.

I just keep picturing rats happily nibbling on Michael Kors dresses as if they’re camembert cheese. I also can’t get the image of Anna Wintour frantically directing Vogue staffers who are on their hands and knees to verify that her office is rat-free. It seems like something from an episode of Ugly Betty or a scene from the sequel to The Devil Wears Prada (which I would totally watch by the way).

If you’re worried about how Anna will deal with this crisis, never fear. Apparently Ms. Wintour is calling in the Olivia Pope of rat exterminators.

A source allegedly told Radar.com the following:

“Anna isn’t amused and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.”

I guess the situation is getting handled. In the meantime, I’ll just keep picturing rats chasing models around the halls of Vogue’s new offices.

The fake story comes from a site called MSNBC.website.com, which some social media users believed was the real MSNBC, but it’s definitely not. The report reads:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

2504,"Seven girls aged between 13 and 14 have fallen pregnant after going on a school trip in Bosnia.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision when the girls, from the town of Banja Luka, returned from a five-day trip to the capital city.

The school had taken 28 girls on the educational outing to Sarajevo to visit museums and other historical sitess, but since returning the girls have now reportedly dropped out of lessons.

Scroll down for video

The 28 schoolgirls were on a trip to the capital of Bosnia, Sarajevo (pictured), when seven returned pregnant

The case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia, where the number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 has increased significantly.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo said that a growing trend for underage pregnancies in Bosnia is worrying.

'That is the trend of today. But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,' he added.

He added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

'It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

'We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.'

Parents of the girls, who are from the town of Banja Luka (pictured), are demanding to know why the teachers were not providing better supervision on the trip

Young girls in Bosnia are seeking advice from experts online, the InSerba News Network has reported.

One schoolgirl wrote: 'I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged.'

Last year in Sarajevo 31 underage girls became pregnant but seven out of 28 girls in one five day period has set something of a record.

The National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, Nenad Babici, admitted more children in his country are engaging in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14.

But he didn't blame the teachers for the school trip pregnancy boom - he said it was down to 'parental neglect'."
2506,"Fidel Castro was pronounced dead on Twitter sometime around 3:59 p.m. on Thursday. It was an unconfirmed rumor, of course, but it was announced confidently so many folks assumed it was true — or at least worthy of retweet.

Then separate rumors started about Raul Castro calling a press conference at 9 a.m. or 11 a.m. today, allegedly to announce his brother’s death.


As South America’s Twittersphere caught fire, some started questioning whether the users in their feed were even talking about the right Fidel Castro. After all, Al Jazeera reported on Jan. 4 that the  Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of Kenya’s main opposition leader, died in Nairobi last weekend after a night of drinking with friends. Could it be that Twitter users were confusing the dead Kenyan man with his Cuban namesake?


Twitter heatmap shows mention of “Fidel Castro” from 10 a.m. Thursday- 8 a.m today (GMT).

An overly excited Wikipedian edited the entry for Cuba’s Fidel Castro to say “this article is about a person who has recently died.” Moments later, the Castro’s Wikipedia entry was reverted back and to his undead version.

By 8 p.m., media outlets around Latin America were reporting “strong rumors” about Castro’s death and the alleged forthcoming announcement by Cuban officials.


But on the island, where folks are more accustomed to rumors of Castro’s death, the situation seemed less urgent. Journalists in Havana said they were aware of the rumors, but weren’t finding echo on the streets of Cuba. It’s true Castro hasn’t been seen in public in a year, but rumors of his death — as Mark Twain might have said — appeared to be greatly exaggerated.


As journalists turned to each other for answers, Cuba watchers tuned into state television.When Castro dies, that’s where it will be announced unequivocally."
2508,"28 girls, aged 13 and 14, from a small town went on a five-day school trip to the capital, Sarajevo. A quarter of them returned pregnant.

It wasn't a pregnancy pact.

Seven Bosnian teenagers became pregnant on a five-day school trip, angering parents and educators, according to public health officials.

The teens, from small town Banja Luka, are 13 and 14 years old, said Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health.

The school took a group of 28 girls on the trip to the capital, Sarajevo, to see museums and city sights, according to inserbia.info. A quarter of the students returned home pregnant.

Parents are demanding why there wasn't better supervision on the trip, according to the Courier Mail. But Babici said parents need to teach their children about sex.

The case has brought national attention to the increasing number of teen pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic said the growing rate is worrisome because teens face higher risks in both pregnancy and child birth.

""We have to be more direct in the educational system,"" he said. ""It must not be allowed that the street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""

2509,"BEIRUT — Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said Tuesday.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early on Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, IS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. had seen the video but couldn't confirm its accuracy and was seeking more information.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria."

But Seidel’s back was facing the camera and it appeared to many viewers he was answering Mother Nature’s call instead of reporting on it. But the network said he had dropped his phone in the snow and was looking for it.

The TV news weather forecast appeared to call for yellow snow — but the network says it was not so.

NBC weatherman Mike Seidel missed a live report from snow-blanketed North Carolina on Saturday night because his back was to the camera. And the way he turned around while also on camera — appearing to zip up the fly of his pants before putting his gloves back on — suggested to viewers that he had been relieving himself.

During the telecast anchor Lester Holt said hello to the No. 1 Weather Channel meteorologist who was in Sugar Mountain, but his back was turned to the camera.

Seidel's body was slightly hunched over and he was looking downward near some trees.

After a few pauses Seidel can be heard asking ""Why?"" as he starts to turn around. The weather man is holding his gloves in his hands despite the cold temperature.

As he turns he slightly moves his arm, which may have been an attempt to close an open zipper. He then hurriedly puts his gloves back on.

A network official told the Daily News that Seidel had dropped his cell phone in the snow and had turned around to find it.

Seidel has tweeted pictures of the snowstorm on his Twitter account, but did not make any mention of the incident.

Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».
«Sa présence était à la fois immense et réconfortante», déclare le prêtre catholique. «Elle avait une voix douce et apaisante et sa présence était aussi rassurante que l'étreinte d'une mère. Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».
Ces déclarations ont provoqué l’émoi dans le clergé catholique de l'archidiocèse, obligeant le cardinal Sean P. O’Malley  à faire une déclaration publique, pour expliquer que Dieu n’était pas une femme et que le père O’neal avait subi des hallucinations."
2519,"On Friday, a rumor cropped up that one of the new Batmobile vehicles had been stolen in Detroit. The story wasn’t verified, but it did end up at a couple bigger news outlets. Because who can resist the phrase “stolen Batmobile”? Thankfully it was all just a rumor, but the story did give Batman v Superman director Zack Snyder a reason to pull together some of the minor resources at his disposal for a great photo op. 

Bleeding Cool had the original rumor, and also hilariously scolded CBS for picking up the story. In an update, the site even praised the Detroit Free Press for killing the story BC created in the first place. The DFP reports:

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

So the Batmobile isn’t stolen; it hasn’t even lost a wheel. All is right in the world, except for the fact that Bats and Supes are fighting again.

All of which brings us to Zack Snyder’s most recent tweet.
This is the latest in a set of back and forth tweets between Snyder and Bad Robot that play around with the DC and Star Wars characters. A couple more are below."
2520,"Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief on Vogue magazine is allegedly displeased with the publications's new 1 World Trade Center offices. Their new workplace at the 25th and 26th floors of the building is said to be infested with rats and vermins. Moving to this new offices may be postponed until the pests are cleared away.

Reportedly, the new 1 WTC offices of Vogue magazine are being swarmed by rodents. Editor-in-child, Anna Wintour, is said to be naturally disgusted and would not step foot into the new offices until these rodents are removed.  The report details that the influential editor-in-chief already asked her staffers to clean her office before she ever set foot in there. Fortunately, Anna Wintour is not yet expected to work in the new offices until 2015. 

A Vogue employee told Gawker last Friday afternoon that the pests cannot be tolerated for work purposes. Moreover, because of the many rodents and vermins scuttling around, the editorial department of the high-caliber magazine might delay its move from the old Times Square offices. The sales and marketing departments have already moved in. The employee added that even though it may sound laughable, but the company is facing a serious concern if these creatures are not removed. The employee explains that there is a possibility that these creatures could nibble the clothing they have in the office.

This rat infestation problem is remarkable considering how excited the company seems to be about moving to their new posh premises. Before this report, Vogue had posted the move in a special online story. The company has also been steadily showing off pictures and videos of the new offices, even Anna Wintour's through Instagram.

Page Six reports that not everyone is sympathetic towards the company.

""Security couldn't even stop BASE jumpers from ­entering the building and leaping from the top. You think they could stop some rats?"" a commenter named ""4npower"" said.

Another commenter, ""Lady­Amanita,"" claimed that the report is nothing short of an exaggeration and that the staff might be confused between mice and rats. ""Rats probably wouldn't want to live on the 25th and 26th floors of a high-rise.""

2521,"The hoax story has been circulating far and wide on Twitter and Facebook

It may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day, but if you see any news stories claiming the Earth is headed for ‘Six Days of Total Darkness’ then don’t start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet.

‘Satirical news site’ Huzlers.com has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week, taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they’re going to be up to during the six days of darkness.

The story on the vaguely official looking website titled “Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!” claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame, causing ""dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90% sunlight”.

This is false. Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena (they occur due to fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic field) they’re not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt.

Instead they create very minor disturbances in the Earth’s magnetosphere. Historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today, but they're mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course – not blot out the Sun.

However, the hoax story even drafts in some credible-sounding sources including Nasa chief Charles Bolden, who reportedly warned the public to stay calm. Some users even linked to a (real) video of Bolden talking about “emergency preparedness” – an official-sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked ‘PANIC’ in the brain.

In actuality Bolden recorded the video to encourage US families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane – natural disasters that are a real enough threat in America.

This total-darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours (some claim that a non-existent “photon belt” is responsible for the blackout) and are so widespread that Nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in 2012."

2524,"President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.

“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Obama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.

Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.

In a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.

In Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.

After beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

2525,"Oh Internet, when will you ever stop killing perfectly healthy celebrities, or at least those that are healthy enough to be alive? Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.

“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)

One of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.

2526,"Update: Since the publication of this article, several people have reported that this may be a hoax.

A 'feminist' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men.

In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true, 'Lana' even expresses surprise that ""many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me"".

The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion.

Read the full blog post here

Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls.

In the blog, Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not ""bring another monster into the world"".

The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco. A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says: ""B****** like you need to learn their place.""

Lana screams ""assault"" and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made.

She then admits considering lying but won't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are ""both back in Economy"".

She adds: ""I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears.

""I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.""

Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced ""crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war"".

Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments.

""I almost threw up after reading this.""

""The most disturbing part of this is what if she didn't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy, what would she have had done then?""

Fact that people abort kids in western world because of gender is thoroughly sick. ""after learning my fetus was male"" http://t.co/YZCR0UDfBu

— Caleb Bond (@TheCalebBond) February 10, 2015

Misandry means hatred of men. Feminism means equality of genders. ""Feminist Has Abortion Because Child Was a Boy"" NO. She is a misandrist

— Jenni (@lifeofjennibeck) February 9, 2015

Since the backlash, Lana appears to have written another blog to defend her position where she claims to have received death threats as a result of the original post.

Unfortunately she misses the point about why people would be angry at her and instead reiterates her right to choose what happens to her body.

I find it hard to hate anybody, their faults are not their own, but usually rather the product of an environment or social circle they have been exposed to. I beg most of you, for your own good, take a look at yourself and decide right now if you want to spend the rest of your life angry on the internet, or if you want to fight for a woman’s right to do what she wants with her body."
2528,"Intelligence agencies hunting for identity of jihadist who murdered reporter

Reports have suggested Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old from London

Abu Hussain al-Britani, 20, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, also potential match

Young men have posed with heads and 'launched cyber attacks on West'

Security sources say they are 'zeroing in' on suspected matched

Police are preparing to raid several British homes to help establish identity

Man in video known as 'John', reportedly in British group called 'the Beatles'

Theresa May poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists

Three British men waging jihad in the Middle East alongside the Islamic State (IS) have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed James Foley in a brutal propaganda video.
The men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the IS capital of Raqqa, Syria. They enter the frame as security sources say MI5 are getting closer to discovering who the executioner, known only as 'John', could be.
The fighter, who spoke with a British accent, butchered Mr Foley, an American journalist, in front of cameras, claiming it was retaliation for U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State (formerly ISIS).

A French prisoner who was held captive by 'John' says he was part of a group of British jihadists who call themselves 'The Beatles'.
Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, a former rapper from London, Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, have been mooted as identities for 'John'.
According to reports in The Sun newspaper, some of the men have similar voices, and even use similar language, to that used in the video.

Security forces have revealed that the information contained in the horrific footage has allowed them to 'zero in' on the wanted man. 
Meanwhile, police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons in order to help establish his identity, according to a report in The Times. Their drive to find 'John' comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Bary, one of the British jihadists, has posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed heard of a Syria soldier, accompanied by a joke.

Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The jihadist, real name Junaid Hussian, later left for Syria, where it has been reported that he is helping mastermind jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell the IS war coffers.

Meanwhile, Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda online, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers to join fighting in the Middle East.
In June, MailOnline revealed an account on the ask.fm social media site, believed to be operated by al-Britani, which gave self-identified youths advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and perks of the job from working with IS.
It comes as British intelligence operatives continue to use advanced recognition software to match known suspects to 'John's' voice.
Security sources revealed to The Times that, thanks to information posted online, MI5 is now 'zeroing in' on the wanted man.
It was also revealed that police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons to help to establish the identity of the jihadist. Meanwhile, a small group of officers from the FBI is understood to be arriving to help British forces with their investigation.
Strict security protocols have also reportedly been put in place to stop classified information leaking to the wanted jihadists or their associates. 
In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said: 'Our intelligence agencies and police are studying the material that we have received.
'You wouldn't expect me to give a running commentary on that process, but we are devoting significant amounts of resource to identifying the individual.' 
He also ruled out an alliance with the Assad regime in Syria to combat the Islamic State (formerly Isis), saying that 'my enemy's enemy is not my friend'.
His statement comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Theresa May said Britain must introduce all the legal powers necessary to win the struggle against terror that is feared to last for decades.
Banning orders for extremist groups will be looked at again alongside powers to stop radical preachers.

Mrs May also underlined changes to the law that mean naturalised Britons who are fighting overseas can be stripped of their citizenship and excluded.
Yesterday it emerged that the group holding Mr Foley has demanded the release of al-Qaeda scientist Aafia Siddiqui. 
The Pakistani mother-of-three, 42, is serving 86 years in a Texas jail for plotting to spread Ebola and make a dirty bomb.

It came as Mr Foley's brother Michael urged officials to reconsider their policy of not negotiating in order to save another US journalist, Steven Sotloff.
He said: 'I hope that Jim's death pushes us to take another look at our approach.'
General Martin Dempsey, Chariman of President Obama's Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday warned that IS had an 'apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision' and could only be defeated by a coalition of partners."
2529,"While Daleks ""know no fear"" and ""must not fear,"" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.

Microsoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.

The squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.

""Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,"" said Li in a March blog post.

The K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.

The K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- ""you are being neutralized.""

The K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.

The robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.

To keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.

""I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or tactical planning,"" states Li."
2530,"More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic."
2531,"A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban, according to reports.

The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network.

This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity.

The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the terror group.

Since their release they have been living in Qatar, which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

US Sen Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country, but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Mr Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to US troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy."
